The   Fij ian   wooden   figurine   (matakau)   on   the  
cover of this book is held in the National  Museum  
of  Victoria  in  Melbourne,  item  2530,  62.2  cm  in  
height,  with  feet  in  the  form  of  dowels  as  if  to be  
held  erect.  One  arm  is  missing.  Exact  significance  
to  Fij ians  is  not  well  understood  and  might  vary  
with the locality. Matakau were iconic,  considered  
a  spirit  but  not  necessarily  worshipped  or  prayed  
to.   This   matakau   is     somewhat   similar   to   the  
famously named Bui ni Nakauvadra.

                                                              by Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara  
  
          Fiji is at the same time a new nation and also one rich in cultural heritage  and tradition. While adapt- 
ing to progress, to economic development, to taking our place  as  a nation in the modern world, Fijians  are  
mindful  that  we  are  a  Pacific  Island  people,  people  with  a  proud  tradition  with  customs,  language  and  a  
way of life that gives us our own identity and stability of social structure, ways of living together  and shar- 
ing in  social responsibilities. We do well to respect our own heritage, culture  and customs that  are  so well  
reflected in the language of our people.  
          It is to this purpose that Professor Gatty writes, for  an  appreciation of our language in the context of  
traditional  culture,  yet  showing  the  adaptability  of  the  language  to  what  is  modern  in  Fiji.  English- 
speaking people may thus learn much of value in understanding and appreciating the bases of our thought,  
our  social  life,  our  ways  of  farming  and  fishing,  our  arts,  crafts,  songs  and  ceremonies,  and  our  ways  of  
talking and thinking about what is new or modern.  
          Fijians  too,  especially  those  who  live  in  towns  remote  from  their  home  villages,  may  learn  and  ap- 
preciate  aspects  of  their  own  culture  and  language  that  their  parents  knew  better  before  them.  Also  they  
may improve their English which is a second language to most of us, though it is now the official language  
of our country. Certainly it is necessary in most responsible positions of employment.  
          Ronald Gatty  is well qualified to  write on this  subject. He  spent  some of his early years  in these  is- 
lands  and villages working  as  a fisherman  and diver.  Ronald left us  as  a young man to  study in  the U .S.,  
later becoming  a professor. He has returned  to us often, exploring  further in Fijian  traditional culture  and  
taking  a  strong interest in Fij i  as  a developing nation. I  am  sure his books will be useful to our own Fijian  
people, to other citizens and residents of Fiji and also to the many visitors who come to Fiji each year.

                                                      A FIRST FEW WORDS  
  
     This book is written both for Fijians,  and for foreigners. So many Fijian youngsters  speak  a j argon that  
could  hardly  be  understood  by  earlier  generations  of  Fijians.  And  being  raised  and  living  in  towns,  our  
youngsters  know  little  of  the  older  customs,  and  little  of  their  heritage  of  animal  and  plant  life  that  is  
briefly  described  in  this  book.    Their  English  too,  is  often  limited  at  best,  as  a  second  language,  with  a  
rudimentary  vocabulary  –  though  English  is  necessary  for  employment  and  advancement  in  the  modern  
world. This book should help them.  
     Similarly, few foreigners understand much of Fijian language, though they live here for years and some  
settle permanently .  Virtually  all Fijians have  a working knowledge of English  so knowledge of the Fijian  
language  is  not  ab solutely  necessary.  But  there  is  no  easy  way  for  foreigners  to  relate  to  Fijians  more  
completely  without  understanding  local  language.  The  Alliance f rançaise  offers  courses  to  the  general  
public that  along with this book should help with a closer understanding.  Both University of Fij i and Uni- 
versity of the  South Pacific offer  accredited courses. But the Fijian heritage involves more that just words  
of the language. It includes the natural environment and native custom, ethnology and social p sychology.   
     Tourists  and  visitors  are  often  impressed  with  the  apparent  open  friendliness  with  which  they  are  
greeted. If visitors stay long enough they will come to learn that relationships  are not nearly  so simple and  
open. The ways of the Fijian, the  social context, the thinking and feeling can be vastly more complex than  
they  ever  dreamed – but  that  at  first  is  not revealed.  People  think  they understand  when  they understand  
nothing.  This book is  a first, very  small  step trying to demystify the enigma that is the Fij ian.  It is only  a  
beginning on a journey of understanding that is never-ending.      
     The  Nature  Garden  (and  Spice  Garden)  at  Wainadoi,  near  Suva,  show  off  many  of  the  trees,  bushes,  
fruits,  vegetables,  medicinal  plants,  dye  plants,  and  scented  flowers  that  have  been  important  to  Fijians  
(and  spices  to  the  Indians).    Both  for  overseas  visitors  and  locals,  especially  schoolchildren,  there  are  
demonstrations of how these traditional plants have been used and much of the lore that has been lost.  
     A  tour  of  the  forest  canopy  can  take  visitors  around  tree-tops  of  the jungle  where  they  experience  the  
view  and the  sight  and sound of birds.  Colourful parrots  are  always an  attraction. You call  and sometimes  
they  will  answer.    In  wonderment,  you  view  the  dancing  streams  and  thick,  dense  jungle  down  below.   
This has been my home for thirty years, following the early and formative years of youth in these islands.  
     The  Nature  Garden  and  Spice  Garden  at Wainadoi have been  featured  on  television  in  Australia,  New  
Zealand  and  Canada  with  demonstrations  of  how  to  use  the  plant  materials.  This  is  an  effort  to  preserve  
and  promote  what  has  been  useful  in  Fijian  culture.    People  from  other  lands  can  learn  something  from  
Fijians. And young Fijians might come  to  appreciate more of their own heritage  and with this dictionary ,  
learn a little English at the same time.  
  
  
                                                               PREFACE  
   
      This  is  a  handbook  for  practical  understanding  of  Fij ian  language,  as  commonly  understood  speech  
one might hear  around  Suva.  Words from Fiji’s regional languages or dialects  are listed only if they have  
become part  of  the  common  vocabulary  that  many  Fij ians understand.  Included  also  are  notes  on  natural  
history and brief explanations of Fij ian customs and culture where they may be important.    
      The only other readily  available dictionary has been Capell ’s with many obsolete  entries  and  a lack of  
modern words  and idioms. This dictionary tries  to present the  language  as it is now.  Capell’s  so-called A  
New Fij ian D ictionary was  first published  almost  seventy years  ago, compiled mostly  from missionaries’  
notes  of  much  earlier  generations.  Revisions  of  1957  and  1968  added  or  corrected  scientific  names  for  
plants,  fishes  and  birds  without  much  change  in  any  of  the  rest.  That  is  archaic !    So  a  new  dictionary  is  
needed.  
     Fijian language is particularly rich in emotion, feelings, the physical senses, social  and family relations,  
and the  context of village life  and  subsistence farming.  It is  strained  and much less useful in  coping with  
the multitude of  foreign contexts, employment, urban living, technology,  and novel  artefacts that pervade  
modern  life  almost  everywhere.  Anglicisms  and  borrowed  words,  so-called  “loan  words”,  dominate  in  
many  situations  that begin  to  sound  artificial.  To  turn  on  a  light  or  turn  it  off,  you  on-taka  or  off -taka  in- 
stead of Me waqa or Me boko.    
     As  spoken  around towns the new Fiji-speak has often hurt my ears. Just  as well, perhaps, that deafness  
with  age has  faded  my hearing  almost  completely.  Fij ian begins  to  sound  like  English  in  translation  with  

                                                                      2

many English words pronounced in a Fij ian  style.  The context of life is very different from ancient times.  
The  old  life-style  and  old  languages  barely  survive  anywhere  but  in  remote  villages.    Already  100  years  
ago  Basil  Thompson  wrote  a book  entitled  The Fij ians:   A  Study  in  The Decay  of   Custom.   And  the  lan- 
guage and culture have changed a very great deal more since that time.    
     This  dictionary has  many  gaps,  omissions  and  no  doubt  a  number  of  errors.  There  was  no  methodical  
checking for completeness. Words  and expressions were gathered  and noted them down as  a quiet pastime  
of  evening  hours.    I  have  been  a  scavenger  of  words  and  languages.  I  was  raised  partly  in  Fij i,  with  my  
family owning Katafaga Island  and  a home  in  Suva. Fijian  studies  then became  an idle  and casual pursuit  
in my  adult life as a scientist  and professor,  and later years,  as  a horticulturist with a tropical garden  and a  
small collection of horses in Fiji. My formal training in language has only been French, German and Latin.   
(My  wife  of  fifty  seven  years has been  a  classical philologist,  steeped  in  Greek,  Latin  and  medieval  lan- 
guages  from  the  Sorbonne,  and  Cornell  University .)  I  had  been  admitted  directly  to  the  Graduate  Pro- 
gramme  at Cornell University without  the benefit of undergraduate training.  This  set  an  academic record  
that has since been matched by several other students during the passing years.   
     My  interest  in  language has been  a  sideline  to  a  deep  interest  in  cultural  anthropology  and  social psy- 
chology.    Language  is  an  approach  to  understanding  a  culture.    For  a  doctorate  at  Cornell  University,  I  
minored  in  Anthropology  with  the  distinguished  scholar  A.  Holmberg  and  tried  to help  Charles  Hockett,  
professional linguist who at the time was  struggling with his interest in Fij ian language. For me Fij ian was  
a language learned during youth without any formal instruction.       
      Fijian  conversation  is  very  sensitive  as  to  who  is  talking  to  whom.  Relationships  of  regions,  tribes,  
clans,  extended  families  and  nuclear  families  are  all  relevant but usually  invisible  to  outsiders.  There  are  
privileges,  courtesies  and  taboos  that  depend  on  those  relationships.  Some  people  may  not  speak  with  
certain others, brothers and  sisters for example or in  some cases, children and  a parent. Virtually everyone  
is related to  everyone  in  some way that determines  the  conditions  of mutual  speech . Formal Fij ian  speech  
has  an  overload  of  verbiage  with protocol  and politesse.  It  may border  on  a  mannered preciosity  that  can  
be quite boring.      
     Still  today,  though,  Fij ian patterns  of  thinking  and  feeling  are  very  different  from  anything  foreigners  
might  expect.  Fij ian  culture  and  social  interconnections  are  difficult  if  not  impossible  for  an  outsider  to  
penetrate. Fij ian openness is never  as open  as it would seem. Questioning a Fij ian on any sensitive issue is  
rather like peeling an onion. Layers are removed but nothing much is revealed at the inside.    
     Fijians usually pretend their thoughts  and feelings are congruent with those of  a  stranger or  a foreigner.  
They  avoid  disclosing potential  discord  of  their  different  motivation,  different  social  aims,  very  different  
manners  and  private  behaviour.  And  some  can  be  masters  at  hiding  their  self-interest.  The  Fijian  smile  
presents a disarming front. The smile serves to charm, disarm, and put the visitor at ease. Sometimes it is a  
mask for dissimulation and manipulation.  More often perhaps, it may be genuine, especially in the case of  
children.  
  
     A Fijian individual living in  a traditional Fij ian context exists within  a  social  system that is much more  
structured than a European usually experiences. Within Fiji, the  system leaves little room for  an individual  
to  act  independently  of  the  group.  At  the  same  time,  for  the  individual,  that  system  can  be  helpful  and  
supportive  emotionally.  Emphasis  is  on  human  relationships,  extended  family,  and  clan,  and  to  a  lesser  
extent, the tribe  and territory,  and quite importantly, their church with their own Fijian versions of Christi- 
anity.  But  these  social  involvements  and  committments  can  be  preoccupations  that  limit  an  individual’s  
development  as  an  individual  and  dissipate  the  personal  resources.    Social  demands  can  exact  enormous  
amounts of time, effort, energy, even money, food and other consumables.    
     Commoners  have  been  restrained  by  their  elders  and  by  their  chiefs  who  with    very  few  exceptions,  
have  little  education,  and  all  too  often,  are  marked  by  self-interest.  Young  people  are  discouraged  from  
expressing opinions or openly  asserting themselves  as  individuals.  Still now, Fijians hardly dare “talk up”  
directly.  Many men,  especially, have been very  considerably repressed.  From  early  childhood  all Fij ians  
are  taught  severely  not  to  ask  questions  and  not  to  speak  their  minds.  It  is  understandable  that  Fij ians  
might become secretive about their own feelings and thoughts. They have had so little personal privacy.  
    It is not easy to understand Fijians and the common fallacy of foreigners is to think they do. Perhaps this  
modest  dictionary  will  help  with  a  little  understanding  of  the  language  and  some  of  its  cultural  context.  
That would be a beginning.

                                           BRIEF NOTES ON THE LANGUAGE  
  
      I  have  wanted  to  write  this  book  as  a  dictionary  with  very  little  grammar,  syntax  or  other  formal  as- 
pects  of  language  that  might  be  boring  to  read.  Al  Schutz’s  The  Fij ian  Language  covers  those  aspects  
only, exhaustively and exhaustingly in something like a thousand pages. (Univ. of Hawaii,  1985.)   
     Originally Fij ian had no written language  and  spelling has varied considerably  since writing was intro- 
duced. There have been differences as to how words or letters should be combined or separated – such as e  
daidai or edaidai (meaning “today”).  The word for “the knife” has been seen as nai sele or na i sele or na  
isele.  That  little letter “i ” transforms the root-word of the verb sele into  a noun.  On  11 March, 2008, the  
Fiji  Cabinet  has  determined  that  all  should  follow  a  newly  imposed  Government  system,  and  I  try  to  
oblige, reluctantly. Along with imposing  a few other rules,  they insist we  attach that little  “i” to the noun.  
Thus na isele is “correct” by Cabinet decision.   
     Government officials are trying to enforce rules of spelling that differ from common practice. Teachers,  
most of  all, resist the change. I believe writers of dictionaries  should follow what people do,  as the people  
write  and  like  to read, rather  than  trying  to  dictate  a  scheme  for  “proper”  spelling.  George  Bernard  Shaw  
tried to rationalise English spelling with absolutely no success.  
     Fijians’ compound words are made up from simple words but it has not always been clear if they are to  
be written joined together  as one word or to be separated by a space. To make things easier for the novice,  
I have  sometimes placed  spaces between  the  little  component  words,  or  in  a  few  cases  I have used  a hy- 
phen  to  separate  them.  It  will be  easier  for  foreigners  to  follow  the  meaningful parts.  But  in  fact,  Fijians  
virtually never use  a hyphen,  and most often run words together when they write.   Some Fijians may find  
my hyphens annoying, and my spacing of words to be awkward.  My apologies for that.   
     A problem  arises with  the  alphabetic  arrangement. Readers may have  to  search  about to  find the word  
they  want.  I  tend  to put  compound  words  close  to  the root-word  that  is  their base, rather  then  in  strict  al- 
phabetical order.   
     Glottal  stops may replace  “t” or  “k”  in  some  areas but locals  are not much bothered by this. In Fij i we  
are  accustomed to the fact the the “v” of mainland Fij i is likely to be replaced in Lau by an “f”,   and a “b”  
replaced by  a  “p”  and  a  “t” replaced by  a  “j ”, these  changes being  an influence of Tonga.   In the western  
part  of  Viti  Levu,  the  “d”  might  be  replaced  by  a    “t”.    We  take  that  in  our  stride  because  in  Fij ian  lan- 
guage, unlike English, it is the vowels mainly that give meaning to a word, not the consonants.    
     Some  teachers  of  Fij ian  language  have  thought  it  useful  to  invent  Fijian  words  for  the  vocabulary  of  
formal  grammar.   Abaca    (pronounced  “Ambatha”)  refers  to  the  ABCs,  the  alphabet.    A  sentence  is  re- 
ferred to  as  a yatuvosa;  a letter of the  alphabet is matanivola,  a  capital letter is  a  matanivola  levu, while  a  
lower case is matanivola lailai.  A full  stop  (a “period” in USA) is digo, a comma koma, a colon koloni,  a  
question mark a cegu taro, and ikovu a bracket.  A noun is a nauni, a kilanauni an adjective, a root-form or  
verb is vu, but a vuwale the intransitive form of a verb,  and dewa indicates the transitive form of a verb.  A  
prefix  is  ikuri  liu.    An  acute  accent  as  itoqa  cabe  and  a  grave  accent  might  be  itoqa  siro.  Et  cetera  will  
appear  as kei na so tale.  A number of these words  are known to very few Fij ians and it would seem to me  
much simpler just to use the English expressions without creating new Fijian words for them.  
     Fijian language  as  spoken today is  a modern Anglicised Fij ian , because the  context of Fij ian life today  
corresponds  closely  to  the  European  context  of  schools,  and  sports,  and jobs  and  urban  life  in  a  money  
economy.  That  is  remote  from  village  life  that  was  more  the  context  of  my  youth.    So  many  youngsters  
today  are  susu  madrai,  literally raised  on  European bread  in  the urban  context,  and know  little  of  village  
culture  or  their  own  heritage.    Many  have  never  visited  the  village  of  their  father  and  a  fair  percentage  
have  never  been  “written  down”  as  belonging  to  a  certain  tribe,  clan,  and  village.    A  relationship  to  the  
parental  village  is  often  no  longer  relevant.  It  can  even  be  an  unwanted  burden.    Mixed  marriages,  with  
Europeans, Indians, Chinese  and Polynesians lend to this trend, and there has been an enormous amount of  
inter-breeding over the last couple of centuries.  That may well bode well for future of Fij i  society to give   
stability  with  more  homogeneity.  But  what  evolves  as  Fiian  language  become  a  polyglot  mixture  of  an- 
cient  Austronesian,  Proto-Central  Pacific  language  of  the  Fiji,  Samoa,  Tonga  complex,  indigenous  Mela- 
nesian,  with  later  Polynesian,  and  European  overlay  and  a  few  Hindi  words  thrown  in.  The  loan  words  
from English  are so many  and so obvious that I omit most of them from this dictionary.  I try to retain the  
original  or  ancient  root-words,  many  that  go back  to  Proto-Polynesian  sources.  In  a  few  cases  I  show  the  
Tongan or  Samoan cognates.  It is the earlier, indigenous cultures  that interest me,  far more than the  mod- 
ern  aspects.

                                          FIJIAN - ENGLISH DICTIONARY   R. GATTY  

  
   
Verb-forms  
     Verbs  are not conjugated in Fijian.  For verb-forms, a word is shown in this dictionary in its basic form,  
and then the suffix or  suffixes attached that make it transitive. For instance, the word sele, seleva is listed.   
That  is sele for the root verb-form  meaning  “cut”, made transitive  as seleva for  “cut it”  (some  say seleta.  
There  are  lots  of  local  variations  in  the  languages  of  Fij i.)   Another  listed  verb  is  moku,  mokuta;    this  is  
the basic verb moku  “hit” with its  added  suffix to become mokuta “hit  something or  someone” or “hit it”,  
as  a  transitive  form  of  the  verb.  A  suffix  may  also  include  an  implied  preposition,  meaning  “for”  or  
“with”, for example. Cicivaka na isele  means to run with the knife. Ciciva means to run for the knife.   
    The  suffix –raka  or –laka   make  a  verb  more  forceful.   Repeated  syllables  also  may  emphasise  the  ef- 
fect of a verb. And a verb may serve equally as a noun or adj ective.   
     Common  prefixes  are  vaka,  creating  an  adverb,  or  vei  or  veivaka  or  dau  that  precede  a  verb-form.   
These  are not all listed but when they do appear, they  are normally found next to the root word they mod- 
ify.  Listing them all separately would burden the volume with too many pages of fairly obvious material.     
  
Noun-forms  
     There are no different genders for nouns  and no different plural forms for  all but  a very few  adj ectives.   
The  only  general  plural  is  one  that  implies  a  set  or  group,  formed  by placing  vei  before  the  noun.    Thus  
kau  plant,  veikau  forest.    loga  ni  dalo    taro  planting-bed,    veiloga  ni  dalo    taro  garden  as  a  set  of  dalo  
planting-beds.  
     Some  nouns  have  a  suffix  that  indicates  a  possessive  pronoun.  For  clarity  here  (but  not  in  everyday  
writing)  I  separate  the  suffix  with  a  dash.  Liga-na    means  “its/his/her  hand”.  My  hand  would  be  ligaqu,  
your hand ligamu, etc.  I leave the details for grammarians to explain.     
     Adj ectives normally follow the noun.  Thus na koli  the dog,  na koli  loaloa  the black dog.  And there  
are just  a  very  few  adj ectives  that  differ  in  the plural.  lalai   small,  is  the  singular,  and  lalai  is  the plural.  
levu  is  big,  with  lelevu  as  a  plural.  balavu  is  long  or  tall,  with  babalavu  the  plural,  leka  is  small  in  the  
singular, leleka small in the plural, applied to more than one thing.   
  
Pronouns  
     Pronouns are perhaps the most unusual aspect of Fijian for the foreigner. The words for “you”, “we”, or  
“they” vary as to how many people are involved.  And the “we”  also varies  as to whether the people being  
spoken to are included or excluded.  Readers may learn the details elsewhere.  
     Possessive pronouns may differ  slightly if they refer to foods, or to beverages.  Fijians distinguish care- 
fully between being the  “owner” of food  (or beverage),  and being the one who will consume  it.  Na noqu  
kakana  is  food  that belongs  to  me.  Na  kequ  kakana  is  food  that  is  mine  to  eat  myself.  Na  noqu  ti  is  tea  
that  belongs  to  me  but  na  mequ  ti  is  tea  that  is  mine  for  me  to  drink.  And  curiously,  Fijians  reckon  that  
they “drink” melon and some other fruits, ice cream, and medicinal pills.   
  
Stress and accents   
      Stress is almost  always on the second-to-last  syllable of a word.  A very few important exceptions may  
be  indicated  in  this  dictionary  by  underlining  the  stressed  vowel.    Some  language  teachers  use  what  is  
called  a  macron,  a  line  over  the  vowel,  but  neither  mark  is  ever  used  in  ordinary  writing  or  printing  of  
Fijian.   
     Cawaki  is  a  sea-urchin, for which the first  syllable is  stressed in pronounciation, not the  second to last,  
which  is  customary.   Underlining  in  this book  may  also  indicate  the prolonging  of  a  vowel  when  that  af- 
fects the meaning.  Dredre refers to  smiling or laughter. Dredre refers to  a difficulty.   Such underlining is  
done here only as a very occasional aid to pronounciation and meaning. It is not usually done here for long  
vowels unless it  is thought  absolutely necessary.  In fact, Fijian is  often  spoken  so fast that there is hardly  
any audible difference. Also, words are run together, as in French, and often in English, unlike the clipping  
distinction of each word,  as  can be  the  case  in German  speech or even Latin,  as I have heard it  spoken by  
present-day classicists when they are talking to each other in a university atmosphere.  
     The  structure of  a Fijian  sentence is quite unlike English  structure. An English  sentence normally runs  
from subj ect to verb to object, as in “The man wrote the book”.  A Fijian might put that as “wrote the book  
the  man”.  And  Fijian  most  commonly  uses  the  root-form,  the  basic,  stative  or  passive  form  of  the  verb,  
rather than the transitive, active form.  But this book avoids the topic of syntax.  

                                                                      5

     Fijian is  also less direct, more wordy  and periphrastic, using  allusions rather than bluntness  and  simple  
clarity.  Preciosity  and politeness  are  fundamental  as  they  are  in  Japanese,  especially  in  formal  situations.  
Traditionally one never mentions a person ’s name and rarely mentions the name of a place. These facts   
  
were communicated in a roundabout way, or implied in a context.  These things are changing, of course, as  
Fijian  drop  some  of  the  old  prohibitions  and  their  syntax  begins  to  mimic  the  European  way  of  saying  
things.    
     Omitted  to  save  space  are  a  vast  number  of  English  words  that  are  pronounced  and  spelled  in  Fij ian  
fashion  but  can  be  readily  understood  and  need  not  be  included.  For  examply,  I  include  basa  for  bazaar  
only  because  the  English  equivalent  may  not  be  obvious.  Archaic  words  are  included  only  if  they  have  
continuing significant relevance in understanding Fij ian culture and history.     
  
  
                                     
                                                        ABBREVIATIONS AND NOTES  
     
     Some  words  may  be  shown  as  Archaic,  Anglicism  (a  English  notion  expressed  in  Fijian),  Slang,  In- 
sults, Vulgar. And a few abbreviations are used :  
     n.  noun-form.    v.  verb-form.    abbrev.  abbreviation.  adj .    adj ective.    adv.  adverb.,  lit.,  literally.  Eng.  
direct copy of  an English word.   Some words may  serve  as nouns,  adj ectives, verbs or  adverbs  with little  
or  no  change.    But  the  structure  and  grammar  of  Fij ian  is  not  directly  applicable  or  comparable  to  Euro- 
pean languages.  
     Words  from  various regions,  or parts  of  those  regions,  are  occasionally  shown  in paretheses.  They  in- 
clude  Lau,  Rewa,  Colo  East,  LomaiViti,  West(ern  Viti  Levu),  Cakau(drove),  Vanua  Levu,  Nadro(ga),  
Navosa,  Ba,  Ra,  Kadavu,  or  words  from  a  few  other  places  or  languages:  Polyn(esia),  Samoa,  Tonga,  
Hindi.  There are  significant variations in Fijian language(s)  and dialects.  Many Tongan or Samoan words  
are  close  cognates of their Fijian equivalent  and  a  few of  these words  are listed. The  contact with Central  
Polynesia has been close certainly  as early as  1000. For an extended period, the  same language was shared  
in  eastern  and  northern  Fiji,  and  what  later  became  Samoa  and  Tonga.  One  might  refer  to  that  as  Proto- 
Central  Pacific  and  some  of  that  ancient  etymology  is persists  in  present-day  Fij an  language.  The  Proto- 
Polynesian  Lapita people  were  in  Fiji  some  three  thousand  years  ago  though  most  moved  on  to  the  east.  
The  influence  of  Proto-Polynesians  and  then  Polynesians  on  Fijian  culture  has  been  profound.    Much  of  
what  is  thought  of  today  as  Fijian  culture has  its  origin  in  Tonga,  especially  from  the  last  750  years  with  
active inter-communications. Samoa but also Rotuma and Futuna have also had effect.

                                                  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  
  
     The notion of writing this book came about from conversations with my friend the late Semesa Sikivou,  
former Minister for Education, Fiji ’s  first Representative to the United Nations  and earlier, Headmaster  at  
Queen  Victoria  School.  At  his  own  insistence,  he  spent  many  Saturday  mornings  reviewing  my  writing  
with  a  critical eye.  I began this particular book only  at his urging.  Also Ratu Kamisese Mara  took  a per- 
sonal interest  and read many  sections of my early work with encouraging comments. He was kind enough  
to  write  a  foreword  for  this  book  several  years  before  his  untimely  death.  He  had  been  a  close  family  
friend and my personal friend for many years, and freely shared knowledge, as did Semesa Sikivou.   
     Similar  encouragement  came  from  the  late  Solo  (Solomone)  T.  Bulicokocoko  who has been  a  leading  
light  in  curriculum  development,  to  teach  Fijian  language  and  culture  to  Fij ian  students.  We  spent  many  
days  together,  comparing  notes  as  he  himself  wrote  source  material  on  legends,  culture  and  language,  
much of it still used in schoolrooms of Fij i.     
     For plant  names  it has been  a  great help  to have had  the  advice  and  writings  of  my  dear  friends,  now  
deceased, B .E.V. Parham, his  son John Parham, and A. C. Smith ; also for trees, the German Forestry Pro- 
ject. For birds  and terrestrial creatures the writings of Paddy Ryan, Fergus Clunie  and Dick Watling have  
been  bountiful  sources.  Both  Watling  and  botanist  Hal  Moore  have  given  me  an  appreciation  for  the  
palms.  (I had been  a  field  assistant to Dr. Moore on his botanical  collecting expeditions  in Central Amer- 
ica  in  the  early  1950s.)  And  Fij i’s  Fisheries  Department  has  provided  scientific  names  of  some  aquatic  
creatures.  In  anthropology  and  archeology,  I  was  greatly  stimulated  by  conversations  more  than  half  a  
century  ago  with  the  late  Ed  Gifford.    And  the  late  Aubrey  Parke  has been  a  soul-mate  in  the  search  for  
knowledge  of  early  Fiji.   We both  saw  that  much  of  what  Fij ians  think  to be  Fijian  tradition  and  culture  
has  evolved  since  the  influx  of  Tongans  and  Tongan  culture  (such  as  the  notion  of paramount  chiefs  and  
the hierarchal ceremony of kava drinking).   
     For  a few words from the various different regional languages,  aside from my own very limited knowl- 
edge, use has been made of  articles by the late Bruce Biggs, Andrew Pawley,  and by P. Geraghty. In quite  
a number of cases I have referred to Capell’s dictionary to check what he has listed.  I do not dwell on his  
errors.  
     Very helpfully, George Hazelman has  carefully read through this dictionary, raising  a number of ques- 
tions,  and discussing the usage of many words  and  correcting  some of my  errors. Fijian might be  consid- 
ered his native language, along with English. Without his help I might never have completed this work as I  
edge past my eightieth year. Memory fades and deafness takes a toll almost completely.     
     For  finally putting the book together, Detlef Blumel is  a professional who has no peer,  and has kindly  
given much of his  time  including the design of the book cover. George Bennett was kind  enough to draw  
the  charcoal  sketch of  the  author. Ms  Sagale Buadromo, Director of the Fij i Museum, has graciously per- 
mitted  the  use  of  a  photograph  of  the  Fijian  idol  (matakau)  on  the  front  cover.  Dom  Sansom  has  given  
some good  advice on printing  and Rod Ewens’ knowledge of handicrafts was  a big help.  I  am very grate- 
ful to these people who have helped bring this book to completion.   
     I  am  very  grateful  also,  in  a  final  editing,  to  have  had  the  help  of  Mr.  Joe  Hewson,  who  was  Senior  
Education  Officer  (Secondary)  of  Fiji ’s  Education  Department.    He  had  the  patience  to  read  through  the  
manuscript and offer comments and his personal encouragement. His involvement, however, was personal,  
and  does  not  imply  official  sponsorship by  the  Department  of  Education.    Also,  the  late  Tevita  Nawadra  
was quite  supportive. He had the opportunity to  study the manuscript and commented at  some length, tak- 
ing precious time in the last year of his life. Nawadra was  strongly opposed to rules  imposed by the Insti- 
tute of Fij ian Language  and Culture with  the  support of Cabinet, but he made no public issue on the  mat- 
ter. Privately, Nawadra  expressed regret that  I  was  accommodating in  complying with  the rules  set up by  
the  Institute.  And  I  note  in  the  vernacular  newspaper Nai  Lalakai  that  Nawadra  and  other  Fijian  writers  
have ignored the imposed system of spelling.   
     In  early  years,  Semesa  Sikivou  went  through  my  writings  as  a  benevolent  despot  and  sternly  added  
many words.  He taught me a great deal,  as indeed he had taught a few generations of Fijian students.  But  
that was many decades ago.    
     After basic  completion of this manuscript there was published  a new dictionary Na  iVolavosa  Vakaviti  
in 2007, almost  1000 pages,  sponsored by the Department of Fij ian Language, written over some 30 years  
by  many  dozens  of  civil  servants  and  a  few  consultants.    It  is  an  overwhelming,  compendious  work  of  
many years  and many native Fijian teachers. They were writing in Fijian to Fijians. With my own transla- 
tions to English, I have  adopted many of their useful entries  that had been omitted from my earlier manu- 

                                                                    7

script.  My book, written by me  alone, is much more limited, containing far fewer of the “loan words” that  
they list very extensively, and fewer regional or local words that are unknown to most Fijians.   
  
  
     My own volume dwells much  more on  aspects of the culture  and natural history  and  is of  course  a Fi- 
jian to English dictionary.   So the two dictionaries  serve different purposes.  Again, I have tried to restrict  
the scope to common knowledge which is really only my own quite limited knowledge. Only the errors are  
mine. I merely arranged the material in a format intended to be useful.   
     My  interest  now  turns  to  a  series  of  volumes  that  I have been  writing  for  more  than half  a  century  of  
idle evening hours. The Tribes of  Fij i is an effort to outline the history of the tribes  and clans of Fijians in  
several volumes, much of that already completed. One might think of these books as social archeology, for  
Fiji has  little  to  show  in physical  archeology.  The  first  volume  concerns  Naitasiri  Province  with  focus  on  
the KaiColo highlanders, the “real Fijians”,  as they  themselves  say : Keitou na kaiViti dina. Tailevu Prov- 
ince will  follow,  and  then the others. Villages  are listed,  with  tribes  and  clans, often with  comments  as to  
their origin,  their  chiefly titles  and  traditions or  specialties,  and relationships with other Fij ian people  and  
places.   
     As  with  this  Dictionary,  I  began  writing  the  series  of  volumes  Tribes  of  Fij i  a  great  number  of  years  
ago,  only  as  a  set  of  notes  for  my  own  understanding.  Perhaps  these  notes  may  interest  others,  though  
there  are  a  very  great  many  gaps  and  certainly  some  errors.  No  one person  can  take  account  of  so  much  
detail. The hope is that some readers might correct my work and add to the research in years to come. This  
could help support a feeling of identity for Fij ians in these times of fast-moving change.

       A  is  usually  pronounced  as  in  “far”,  and  more  rarely  as  in  “cat”.    In  Lau,  the  letter  y  may  be  
pronounced  in  front  of  a  at  the  beginning  of  a  word  or  a  person ’s  name  that  begins  with  an  a.    For  
example, the title Adi may be heard as Yadi.  The word for tuna fish may be heard as atu or yatu.

     under  influence  of  Lau.  When  followed by  a  name,   Adi  may be heard  abbreviated  informally  as  Di,  
     as in Di Lala for Adi Lalabalavu, and this short version is not disrespectful. Like the man ’s chiefly title  
     Ratu,  this  form  of  address  was  limited  to  the  eastern  coast  of  Viti  Levu  but  has  become  commonly  
     adopted by chiefly women throughout Fiji. The origin may  come  from the Ra word yadi  (also used in

     is idle speculation.

ibalebale    n.  meaning.   A  cava  na  kena  ibalebale?    What  does  it  mean ?  ibalebale-rua    double  meaning  
     (this is a modern Anglicism).  balebale-rua  to have a double meaning, homonym.   
vakaibalebale  adj . meaningful, has meaning.   
balei  (Colo  East,  Namosi)  n.  snake.  This  is  a  totem  of  tribe  Naleya  at  village  Nasava,  Noemalu  District,  
    Naitasiri.  A closely related word, Baleni, refers to a ten-headed snake godess around village Vunikodi,  
    Macuata  Provice,  and  there  is  there  a  clan  called  Baleni.  The  title  Rokobaleni  exists  among Waimaro  
    Fijians,  tribe  Navakavu,  villages  Muaivuso  and  Togalevu,  at  the  coast  of  Rewa  Province.  The  
    implication  is that of  a  snake,  though present-day  locals  are unaware of  that  connection. A distinctive  
    fern  that  grows  around  tree  trunks  is  known  as  Snake  Nest  in  Cakaudrove  (sova  ni  gata)  and  on  the  
    Waidina  River  of  Colo  East  (sova  ni  balei).  Sold  as  a  large household  ornamental,  this plant  is  often  
    known  among  Europeans  as  Antler  Horns  or  Staghorn,  names  not  listed  in  my  botanical  references.   
     Syn. gata.   
veibaleyaki   adj .   indeterminate,  ambiguous,  going  this  way  and  that  way.   Sa  veibaleyaki  tiko  na  uluna.   
    His/her head is nodding this way and that way.   
balekana  n.  var.  of  breadfruit  with  small,  long  fruit  that  has  smooth  skin.    It  matures  early  and  may  be  
    eaten when it falls, which is implied in the name.    
baleravu  n.  fire-torch of bamboo or other improvised bush material used  still today to light one ’s way  at  
    night  around  the  village.  The  word  implies  the  damage  done  if  the  torch  falls.  Traditional  housing  is  
    very  combustible  and houses usually built  close  together.   For  such  torches highlanders used bamboo  
    while coastal Fijians normally used dried coconut spathes (flower shoots) called bawara.   
balesi  broken off but still hanging (as with a tree-branch).  
baleta  1. because  (or, in  a question) because of what, why. Baleta na cava ?  (or) Baleta ?  Why?  (Because  
    of what?).  
baleta 2. concerning, as in  na veika baleti au.  the things concerning me (about me).

bali, balia  v. to knead,  as of Fij ian  vakalolo  pudding, or  modernly, dough for baking.  (Fijians  anciently  
     had no knowledge of yeast or leavened bread.)  
balia  (Vanua Levu) n.  mad, insane, mentally unstable, of a person.   
balibali or balikali adj . clumsy, of a person.  
baloa    black,  or  blackish,  usually  of  skin  colour.  Fijians  can  be  colour-conscious  and  will  sometimes  
     remark on how dark or light a person ’s skin is.  Traditionally, many of the blacker, “true” Fijians of the  
     highlands have felt disadvantaged. They have in several places  accepted as chiefs immigrant Tongans,  
     who have  fair  skins,  as  for  the  Noemalu,  and  at  the  Nadroga  coast.  On  a  few  occasions,  Fijians have  
     accepted  Europeans  as  incoming  chiefs  (Clan  Naulucavu,  for  example,  at  Nakorosule,  and  also  the  
     kaiNadakua in  Sawakasa, Tailevu).  Fijian mothers  are often proud to have  a light-skinned child.  Skin  
     bleaches  (whiteners)  are  advertised  in  the  Fijian  language  newspapers,  as  are hair-straighteners.   This  
     topic  is  a  sensitive  one,  and  a  complicated  one.  Black  warriors  of  the  Fiji highlands have had  a  great  
     reputation  as mercenaries in Tonga  and  also in  the Tui  Kaba conquest of Lakeba  Island  accomplished  
     by  the  “Black  Regiment”,  literally  “Black  Pigs”    Vuaka  loa,  famous  for  their  courage  and  fighting  
     skills. They were proud of being black.    
balobi  sulu   n. bolt  of  cloth,  lobi,  lobia  to  fold.   e  va  na  balobi  sulu   four bolts  of  cloth.   Bolts  of  cotton  
     cloth  are important gift items  at  some modern Fij ian  ceremonies.  (In coastal  areas, barkcloth has been  
     used,  especially  in  areas  of  Polynesian  influence.)  The  long  stretch  of  cloth  is  strung  out  on  display,  
     brought  forward  by  a  procession  of  women ,  showing  it  off.    Highlanders  never  had  the  mulberry  
     barkcloth, and never had such grand ceremonial displays.   
balolo   n.  an  edible  sea-worm,  the  annelid  Eunice  viridis  (formerly  Palolo  viridis),  found  only  in  certain  
     places, but not at Viti Levu.   Balolo appears once or twice a year at only about  100 coastal locations in  
     Fiji but  at  any one place it may not recur annually, or may occur only once  (as  at Lakeba).  Elsewhere,  
     outside  of  the  usual  places,  Fij ians  may  never  have  seen  it  or  tasted  it,  but  they  have  all  heard  of  it.  
     Early  in  the  morning  the  annelids  rise  in  a  spiral  from  coral  sand,  brown  male  sperm  sacs  and  green  
     female  egg  sacs  in  the  form  of  worms  that  intertwine  and  fertilise,  squirming  to  the  surface.    By  the  
     time  the  sun becomes  strong,  around  eight  o’clock,  they  will  disappear.  The  transparent  eggs become  
     invisible  and  the  thin  coloured  skins  seem  to  evaporate  to  nothing.  The  balolo  also  exists  in  Samoa,  
     Tonga,  and  the  islands  off  Japan .    qoliva  na  balolo    fish  for  the  balolo.    tagava  na  balolo    net  the  
     balolo.  Collection  may  involve  many  village  people.  When  quantities  are  great,  much  will  be  given  
     away.  It  is  contrary  to  custom  that  balolo be  sold, but  Lautoka  market  now  does have  some,  cooked,  
     for sale.   
         On Vanua Levu it occurs only on the northeastern coast from  Saqani to Udu, and on the southeastern  
     coast  from  around  Nasavusavu  to  village  Dakuniba.  Geraghty  also  names  some  islands  around  
     Vanualevu :-    Kia,  Cikobia,  Naqelelevu,  Rabe,  Yanuca,  Taveuni  (at  Vuna  and  Lavena),  Qamea,  and  
     Laucala.             
         Other  locations  are  in  LomaiViti  (Tokou,  Ovalau,  Wakaya),  Yasawa    (Mamanuca,  Waya),  Lau  
     (Lakeba,  Naidi,  Susui,  Avea,  Udu  at  Kabara,  Vanuavatu,  Vatoa),  around  the  south  coast  of  Kadavu  
     (village Muani  and  according to Geraghty,  from Nabukelevu to Galoa,  and  Soso to Vacalea),   and off  
     the south coast of Vatulele Island.    
          At  Lakeba  Island,  various  of  the  villages have  a  different  seafood  that  they  call  their  balolo,  which  
     appears  in  abundance  only  once  a  year.    Village  Tubou  has  the  true  balolo.  Nukunuku  has  the  fish  
     nuqa. Waciwaci has the red land crab lairo in late November to December, and the salala fish in April.  
     Vakano has the unicorn fish ta, and a type of  bill fish saku. Saqalau has the shark qio damu. Drano has  
     the  fish  tugadra,  similar  to  the  salala,  and  also  the  fish  kalawa.   Waitabu has  the  land  crab  lairo  and  
     the  small black  reef  eel  boila.   Elsewhere  in  Fij i,  village  Namara  in  Tailevu has  the  fish  nuqa  that  is  
     their balolo.  vula  i balolo lailai  October-early November, when the balolo has its minor  season.  vula  
     i balolo levu  November-early December, when the major  season may occur,  according to the phase of  
     the moon and the weather, and other factors unknown.   
         Rising of balolo usually occurs 7 to 9 days after the full moon, from midnight to 4 am, on the falling  
     tide, lasting into the early daylight hours. The rising is often preceded  a day or  two by the  appearance  
     of  scum  on  the  surface  of  the  sea.  At  this  time,  in  many  places,  Fijians  are  fearful  of  “red  tide”  that  
     causes the flesh of certain reef fish to become poisonous to humans.   
          At western areas of Fiji, balolo occurs usually earlier than in eastern  areas. In Samoa, however, it is  
     a couple of week s earlier.   

                                                                 13

         In the  early morning, until  about  8  am, the  annelids  are  sieved up in tins, fine-mesh nets,  and  cloth ,  
     as  they  spiral in  thick  streams to the  surface from the  sandy bottom.  (I have observed them  and  swum  
     amongst  them  as  a  diver.)  Males  are  brownish  and  the  females  are  green  but  otherwise  they  look  
     similar.   When  exposed  to  the  sun,  they  appear  to  dissolve,  leaving  only  a  few  drops  of  water  which  
     then  evaporate.   The  segment  of  the  animal  that  rises  is  composed  almost  entirely  of  tiny  transparent  
     eggs  or  sperm  covered  by  an  extremely  thin,  fragile  coloured  skin  that  itself  becomes  virtually  
     invisible when burst open.   
         Balolo  are  eaten  raw,  living  and  writhing,  or  cooked  in  the  earth  oven,  all  with  some  joyous  
     ceremony. They  can be frozen,  and they can be fried.  There  is  a tradition of first presentation  (isevu)  
     to  the  chief,  then  a  wide  distribution  to  relatives  and  friends.    Rain  often  falls  after  the  balolo  have  
    risen.  Sa cabe cake mai na balolo.  The balolo are rising.    taga-va na balolo   net the balolo.  na te ni  
     balolo   the sea scum remnant of the balolo.  Syn. (Kadavu)  baya .   
       Idiom :  E kua gona ni balolo, me na kua sara.  “Now or never”,  If this opportunity is not grasped, the

     quickly.

     into  the  mouth  of  a  young  woman,  as  might  be  done  if  their  peoples  are  tauvu  dredre,  kin-groups,  
     closely  related  in  a  very  hard joking  relationship  with  the  people  playing  tricks  on  one  another.  The  
    Waimaro  people  of  Matuku  Island  in  Lau  are  related  this  way  with  Waimaro  people  of  the  eastern  
     highlands  of  Viti  Levu.  When  the  two peoples  meet,  great  liberties  are  taken  that  can be humiliating  
     and very frightening to youngsters.  Real injury is never done.

bani   1. (Eng.) n.  bun (as from a bakery).  Modernly,  a Fijian breakfast is  a fried or boiled bani for which  
     there  are many local names.  In urban  areas on Good Friday  a primitive Fiji version of hot  cross buns  
     is  imperative,  and  replaces  virtually  all  other  breads.  These  are  very  simple,  virtually  tasteless  buns,  
     sold  by  the  dozen,  each  one  marked  crudely  with  a  red  cross  painted  on  with  food-dye.    It  is  a  
     necessary  ritual,  not  at  all  a  gastronomic  occasion,  rather  like  the  concept  of  a  birthday  cake,  which  
     modern urban Fij ians also insist on.  The cross must be red colour.   
bani  2.  (Eng.) n.  band (musical).  Au sa laki sara bani.  I am going to watch a band play .  More fully the

beka  1.  n.    may  refer  to  small  insect-eating  bats  but  more  usually  to  the  large,  very  visible  Flying  Fox,  
     three  species, mainly the Polynesian Flying Fox.  It is eaten especially by hill tribes, caught by prickly  
     vine nets, or by stoning, or by shaking a tree where one hangs. When the tree is shaken, the bat falls to  
     the  ground,  temporarily  disoriented.  Fijians  have  usually  boiled  the  bat  whole,  and  then  easily  pluck  
     off the fur. They eat the guts after squeezing out the gut, which is not considered dirty . In the highlands  
     the bat was usually grilled (tavu) over a fire.   
          Fruit bats can become very friendly pets, and can be stroked on the neck and on the nose. They may  
    be  let  to  fly  free  and  the  males  especially,  will return  to  a person  who has  fed  them.  They  eat  fruit  of  
    bananas, papaya,  the  sa  tree,  kavika  tree,  and  flower  shoots  of  the yaqoyaqona.   They have  excellent  
     vision,  and  sense  of  smell  but  cannot  echo-locate,  as  the  smaller,    insectiverous  bats  do,  who  live  
     around  caves.  They  scout  around  dusk,  flying  alone,  in  pairs,  and  sometimes  in  a  pair  of  couples.  In  
     certain locations  at certain times they may  appear  as  a great cloud of thousands; this is thought to be  a  
     sign of impending bad weather with the bats looking for food in  advance.   Settling into  a tree  at night,  
    bats  may  fill  the  tree.  Against  a  torchlight  their  eyes  may  gleam  like  a  thousand  little  lights,  a  
     fascinating  sight.   The  beka  dina  sleep s  more  in  daytime.  The  beka  lulu  is  active  in  daytime,  and has  
     much lighter colour fur. Syn. (Tonga) p eka.  (West)  bekwa. (Kadavu)  doli.

     and  these  do  sprout  easily.)    See  bele-na.  The  edible  leaves  are  mucilaginous  and  bitter  but  cooking  
     water is often consumed, neither bitter nor slimy if it is not stirred too much.  Medicinal use of leaves,  
     heated  over  a  fire  and  then  placed  on  boils.    Also juice  extracted  to  ease  menstruation  or  childbirth.  
     The  plant  is  propagated  by  cuttings.    Syn.  (Namosi,  Colo  East,  Rewa)  vauvau  (ni  Viti).  (West)  waci,  
     sasau.    (Kadavu)  momoke.  The  variety  of  names  might  suggest  that  this  green  was  introduced  
     separately  from  various parts  of  eastern  Melanesia.   It  was  indigenous  to  Southeast  Asia,  still  widely  
     cultivated  in  Malesia.  Available  all  year  but  mainly  December,  January.  Bele  damudamu  is  hardier,  
     more durable, less susceptible to rot, smaller somewhat tougher leaves; bele vulavula and regular green

    walks  or  scampers  rather  than  flying.  Can  become  charmingly  cheeky  and  rather  unafraid  when

     starchy root-crop, usually cassava these days but formerly, traditionally, from ivi, Polynesian chestnut.  
    Grated  coconut  and  sugar  is  sometimes  used  in  the  preparation.  Wrapping  is  with  leaves,  usually  of  
    masawe  (=  vasili=  qau),  Cordylene  terminalis.  Village  Naila,  Tailevu,  has  a  reputation  for  making  
    famously good bila. It is sold in the Suva market as a snack food.    
    sikivoro  is  a  somewhat  similar  food.   Idiom:   na  kena  bila  refers  to  one’s  specialty,  a  special  skill  or

     advice  of  others.  Recipients  attending  the  ceremony  will  feel  offended  if  they  are  not  alloted  a  fair  
     share,  and they are watching closely.   Idiom:  ibilibili o tuirara   Excessively large share selfishly kept  
    by  the  tuirara  for himself.   The person  dividing up   goods  to be  shared  may be  accused  of  favouring  
    himself.    
bili, biliga  v. to push.  tamata biligi  n. outcast. veibili  push each other   veibilibili  accuse each other.   
       Idiom :  bili ni mua  idiom,  lit.  "shoving off" (of boat, departing), by extension, ceremonial giving and

ibili ni koro  n. outskirts of village.  
bilibili  1.  n.  raft,  usually  of  bamboo,  made  in  Colo  East,  Wainibuka,  and  Namosi  to  descend  the  river  
     system  to  the  coast.  The  Wainimala  and Wainibuka  Rivers,  and  then  the Waidina  River  all  flow  into  
    the Wailevu River (Rewa River), that leads  south to the Suva area. Propulsion is by the current, and by  
    poling  and  pushing,  as  implied  by  the  word.  Fijians  may  live  on  the  raft  for  three  days  or  more.  
    Platform was  advisable for bananas, not to get  soaked, but not necessary for taro which withstands the  
    wetness  well.    Bananas  were  grown  in  the  highlands,  but  also  taro  and yaqona,  and  then  transported  
    down  to  the  coast,  to  sell  around  Suva  or  Nausori.   The rafts  never  make  the return journey  and  thus  
    may  be  referred  to  as  “HMS  no  come  back”.  In  some  cases  they  have  been  sold  cheaply  for  use  in  
    building in the lowlands, where bamboo is more scarce. bilibili are  still reasonably common, because it  
    is  expensive  to  rent  punts  with  outboard  motors,  or  trucks  for  the  roads  that  now  penetrate  the  
    highlands of Viti Levu.

ibilibili 2.  n. portion of feast food shared out. It is placed out, often pushed there (as implied by the word),  
     in  a  heap.  The  quantity  and  quality  are  noted  very  carefully  by  recipients  who  are  sensitive  to  any  
     slight.   
bilo  n. cup.  bilo iloilo  glass (for drinking). bilo kava  tin cup, bilo yaqona  cup of yaqona, bilo ni yaqona   
     cup  for yaqona,  a  smoothed half-shell  of  a  mature  coconut.    Cups  did  not  exist  in  any  form  in  olden  
     times.  Water  and  even yaqona  was  normally  lapped up.  Sometimes  a  temporary  cup  was  improvised  
     by folding  a  leaf but  that was used only  for carrying  a little water  a  short distance. It was then lapped  
     up or poured into someone’s mouth.  
     Idiom:  bilo cicila  undependable, cannot be relied on (person), lit. like a leaky cup.    
     Idiom:  bilo  vata  words that might be  said  in humour,  suggestively, by  a man to  a woman,  as in Daru  
     sa  bilo  vata,  kedaru.    We,  we  two  share  the  same  cup,  have  much  in  common,  and  should  have  an  
     intimate relationship.    
vakabilo  has  a  cup,  is  supplied  with  a  cup.   As  an  idiom,  a person  can be  said  to be  vakabilo,  meaning  
     bewitched,  having  magical  powers  derived  from  pouring  a  cup  of  yaqona  to  an  evil  spirit.    Once  a  
     Fijian relates to  a  “devil”  (tevoro)  in this way to  carry out his  (usually  evil) wishes, he must regularly  
     continue to pour cups of yaqona to his devil, or great misfortune will befall him.  In effect, in Faustian  
     fashion, he has  made  a pact  from  the  devil  and  cannot  withdraw  from  it.   In  a  very  different  context,  
     vakabilo may refer to someone of chiefly rank,  as if they have been installed by having been given the  
     official cup to drink, i.e. they have been vagunuvi.   
bini (or) pini  (Eng.) n.  peas, cooked, dried and  salted, sold in the  street  as a  snack.  The  same word may  
     apply  to  green beans,  mostly  the  very  long beans  grown by  Indians,    eaten  as  a  vegetable.  p ini  may  
     also refer to clothes-pins, or paper-clip s used in an office.   
bilobilo  n. kneecap.   
bini, binia  v.  to pile up.   
ibinibini  n.  pile, heap.

     put up  (poster on the wall).  vakabira na sitaba e na mata ni waqa ni  ivola.   Stick  a postage  stamp on  
     the front of the envelope.

     birika implies more force.  B irika na nomu taunamu.  Open up your mosquito net.   
bisa, bisa  1. v.  to complete something difficult.   
bisa, bisa  2.  v.  to fall  suddenly, to pour down, of rain usually but could  apply to mud in  a landslide, or  
     anything that flows. bisa  to rain on something.    
bisa, bisa  3.  v. to  arrive,  come or occur  suddenly  (not  a common expression).  au bisa ga yani na nona  
     lako tiko.  I just arrived as he was going.   
bisikete    (Eng.)   n. biscuit, usually  referring  to  the  local breakfast biscuits,  such  as  Lee's brand  or  Punj a  
     brand.    Fijians  often  dunk  tonia  biscuits  in  tea  and  slurp  them,  especially  those  with  poor  teeth.   
     bolomo  refers to a thorough soaking or dunking.  
      Idiom:  tei bisikete. refers to planting biscuits, a joking, but unkind remark made about Rotumans, as if  
     they were incompetent gardeners. Expression comes from a supposedly true event. A man of  a specific  
     Rotuman family, a man of feeble mind, got the notion of planting biscuits.    
bisinisi      (Eng.)    n.  business.    na  dau  (ni)  bisinisi    the  businessman.  caka  bisinisi    to  “do”  business  (a  
     modern Anglicism). cicivaka na bisinisi  to run the business.  Also an Anglicism.

bitalaka  v.   to  throw  forcefully.   bitalaki   thrown  forcefully ,  as  a  man  from  a  motorcycle,  or  a boat  in  a  
     storm, thrown ashore.

biti!   (Eng.)  Bitch ! in vulgar insults  among women,  sometimes called out in friendly, jocular manner to  a  
     woman who is too elaborately dressed, or  putting on airs.  Not as vulgar as it would sound in English.   
bito  (West) n.  clan, or extended family . Syn. for extended family:  tokatoka in central  and parts of eastern  
     Fiji.  (Lau)  batinilovo.    In  the  west,  the  earlier  immigrants  (before  arrival  of  the  Nakauvadra  people)  
     had no concept of tribe   
     yavusa..    The  western  bito  or  beto  corresponds  to  the  highlanders’  bure,  essentially  a  clan  or  large  
     extended family, the key kinship unit. In the highlands these  adult men  all lived together in their bure.  
     There  could be  several  bure  in  a  village. Wives  and  children  lived  separately  from  the  men  in houses  
     vale.

bitu    n.  bamboo.  bitu  ni  wai    n.  bamboo  container  formerly  used  for  water  in  formal  mixing  of  yaqona  
     beverage,  still  occasionally used  at  formal  ceremonies.   Three  main  species:   bitu  kau  the  indigenous  
     Schizostachyum  glaucifolium,  large  and  woody,  not  at  all  flexible, used  for  cooking  in highlands,  for  
     carrying   and   storing  water,   and  for  rafts   (bilibili),   as  well   as  for  wall  posts   set  vertically  or  
     horizontally .    Much  more  common  is  the  introduced  bitu  dina,  “true  bamboo”,    Bambusa  vulgaris,  a  
     flexible bamboo, thinner, not  as  strong, the flattened  stem often interwoven in  sections to form house- 
     walls,  which  is  not  an  indigenous  technique.    bitu  sici  Bambusa  multiplex ,  a  very  thin-stemmed  
     introduced  var.  of bamboo;   children  make  a  whistle  sici  from  this  species  and  it  is  occasionally used  
     as an ornamental shrub, or to create a fence      
          Green,  immature  bamboo  is  not  a  wood  that  endures  unless  treated  chemically .  The  "fur"  at  the  
     growing tip can cause irritation if it touches one's skin. Some Fijians are aware that bamboo shoots  are  
     edible but they have been eaten only very rarely.   
          The  only knife known  to highlanders  was  improvised  from  split bamboo,  which  is  extremely  sharp  
     but dulls  easily.  Sharpness was restored by pulling  away  some with the  teeth. In  the highlands, where  
     the  earth-oven  was  unknown  and  there  were  no  clay  pots,  cooking  was  done  in  sections  of  bamboo,  
     held  over  the  fire,  and  turned,  so  it  would  not  burn .  This  was  referred  to  as  vuki,  from  vuki,  vukica,  
     meaning to turn over. Syn. (Kadavu) duvu. (Polyn.) kof e and cognates  ‘of e, ohe. ko ’e.   
           Idiom:    Vaka  la  e  boko  na  buka  bitu.    ended  suddenly,  as  a  fire  of  bamboo  goes  out  suddenly,  
     leaving no coals.  
           Idiom:   Vaqara  bitu   said  of  or by  women ,  to  go  look  for  a  man  for  sexual  and romantic purpose.  
     The rationale behind  this  is probably  the  similarity  in  shape  of  the  young bamboo  sprouts  to  an  erect  
     penis. One  comparable  expression for men is “to capture red-feathered parrots”   tobo kula, when they  
     are on  the  look-out to  find  a woman  to have  sex.  To have  these  expressions with  sexual implications  
     does not necessarily mean that many Fijians did these things but that they have talked about it.   
bitu  ceguvi  (or)  bitu  ucu  n.   (Archaic)   nose  flute  musical  instrument  formerly used by  men  or  women,  
     blown  through    one  nostril.    Virtually  no  one  has  the  skills  today  and  we  have  practically  no  
     knowledge  of  the  type  of  music.  The  instrument  was uncommon  and  quite unknown  in  the  Viti  Levu  
     highlands.  
biu, biuta 1. v.  to put, to place.   biuta ena kovate  put it in the cupboard.  Syn. (Colo East)  bite, biute.   
biu,  biuta  2.    v.  to  depart,  to  leave.    biuti  Suva    leave  Suva.  biuta  na  vanua    leave  the  country.    na  biu  
     vanua  the emigration, departure for overseas, the emigrants. (curu vanua  immigrate).  
biu, biuta 3.  v. to discard,  cast  (anchor). biu-iyaragi   to disarm, disarmament.  biuta  laivi v.   to  throw it  
     out, throw it away. Syn. (Rewa)  kavotaka  v. to throw it out.   
biubiu  v. to leave, depart.  Sa biubiu ena noa   He/she/they departed yesterday.   
biubiu  n. people departing, those people who are leaving or the departure itself.

     sa veibiu kei na watina.   He/she divorced his/her spouse.  Daru sa veibiu eke.  Let us leave each other  
     here.   
biu cakacaka  v., n.  to go on strike, the strike, work stoppage, strikers.   
biukila  (Eng.) n. bugle,  trumpet,  also  the Trumpeter brand of  cane-knife, preferred by many Fijians, who  
     refer to it with their version of the brand name.   
biuvuli  n., v.  school-leaver(s), to quit school.    
bo  root-word used in many combinations, meaning squeeze. veibobo  massage.    
bo    1.  n.  boil  (Med.).    This  is  a  common  complaint,  probably  due  to  crowded  living  and  sleeping  
     conditions  in  many  Fij ian  dwellings.    Infection  can  occur  through  mutual  touch,  through  any  slight

     seek).  boboka na ivaka-sa-ribariba  squeeze the trigger.   
veibobo  n.,  v.  body-massage,  a highly  evolved  skill  in  Fiji.  This  is  considered by  eastern highlanders  to  
    be an introduced coastal concept. Highlanders never developed any body oil-lotions.    
boboraka  v.  to squeeze rapidly and forcefully many times,  as in squeezing orange juice, or in softening a

     allies  (Cakobau  gave  some  Lovoni  slaves  to  the  Tui  Cakau  but  he  sold  many  of  them  to  white  
    planters). Usually they were war captives. Commoners were sometimes virtual  slaves to the chieftains,  
    but  often happy  enough,  accustomed  to  that  servitude.  In  some places  still  today,  dependant relatives  
     may  be  treated  as  virtual  slaves  within  a  family.    The  Tui  Cakau  has  in  a  previous  generation  used  
    prisoners as slave labour on his farmland.    
boci  adj .,  n.  uncircumcised,  for  a  male  adult  a  despised  characteristic,  implying he  never became  a  man.

     the host will give a traditional response.)   The passing of a number of days is spoken of as the number  
     of  nights  that  have  passed.  Feasts  mark  certain  numbers  of  days  that  have  passed  after  a  birth  or  a  
     death :    bogi  va    four  nights,  a  ceremony  4  days  after  a  death,  birth,  or  circumcision,  bogi  tini      “ten

     a  white  chevron  on  the  top  of  their head.   Extremely  few  Fijians have  ever  seen  one  and  most  do  not  
    know of its existence.  One never hears of anyone being bitten by the snake and it normally scurries off  
     and  disappears  very  quickly.   Paddy  Ryan  suggests  it  is probably  nocturnal.   Living  in  the rain  forest  
     and  jungle  for  decades,  I  have  encountered  it  only  once.  They  are  perhaps  best  known  in  Namosi  
    Province   and   Colo   East,   where   they   have  been   eaten.   They   live   in   dead,   rotting   vegetation.  
    Highlanders  catch  them  with  a  forked  stick.  Some  believe  they  render  it  harmless  by  rubbing  the  
     snake's mouth  and teeth with the cut  stem of via milamila, Alocasia indica, Araceae, which has  a very  
    irritating  sap. Curiously, this is  spoken of  as  "sawing"  (varo, varota) the teeth.   It would  seem to be  a  
    dangerous treatment.  
bologa, bololaka  v.  to heave, throw heavily, an object, a kick or a punch.  To smash into pieces.   
bolomo  v.,  n.   to  steep  or  dunk  a  starch  food   e.g.,  chunks  of breadfruit  most  commonly but  also  taro,  in  
    coconut  cream  (lolo),   or  a biscuit  in  tea,  a  favoured  and  acceptable  way  of  eating.   Steeping  tends  to  
     soften starch foods which is helpful to older people whose teeth are weak.  toni, tonia  to dip or dunk.   
bona   v.,  n.  adj .  stink. putrid.  Occasionally used pejoratively  to  a  person;   also,  in  children's  game  of  tag  
    veibona, the word is exclaimed to mean  "you are 'it' !"  Syn. (Kadavu)  busi.   
Boni  Vilive    n.  Burns  Philp,  major  department  store,  Australian  origin  now  under  the  name  of  Courts.

bonu    n.  swamp  eel  or  mud  eel  sp.,  very  thin  body  up  to  a  meter  long  but  hardly  more  than  an  inch  in  
    thickness, pointed nose, lives beside creek s, in drains, thriving in mud. It never lives right in the creek s  
    but  only  alongside.  A  good  food,  to be  caught  with  care by hand  but  it bites  when  grabbed.  One  can  
    reach into  the  slender mud holes but the bonu can move  as  easily in reverse  as  it can forward. Brown  
    on the back, white underneath. One type is the bonu loa, which is  short and has more distinctive beak- 
    like head. The other, longer type is the “true” bonu dina.  Fij ians do not consider bonu as  a type of eel  
     (duna), possibly because it does not live in creek s or rivers.  There is  a river named Wai-ni-sulu-bonu,  
     a tributary into the Wainadoi, near the coast of Namosi.   
bora, borota, boralaka  v.  to bawl out,  reprimand.   
bore, borea  v.  to wash, usually of utensils or food.  bore vakawai  to rinse without washing completely.

    medicine. It grows by the mangrove  shore or in brackish, boggy areas, and is unknown at sandy shores  
     and in the highlands. It is never cultivated.  Syn.  boresi, babasiga, caca, (Lau,, Cakau) vativati.

    formerly important in  the diet, now mostly neglected, replaced by  bele  and  tubua,  and  to  some  extent  
    by  European  vegetables  (English  cabbage)  or  oriental  greens  (Chinese    cabbage,  mustard  greens).

     •  boro  dina    Solanum  uporo,  formerly  S.  anthropophagorum,  smooth  leaves,  small  tomato-like  fruit  
    yellow  or  red.  Seeman  considered  the  plant  a  digestive  that  was  eaten  in  association  with  human  
    bodies in cannibal times.  Eastern Polynesians have used the red fruit in floral necklaces.   
     • boro sou, sou, (or) sousou  S. repandum,  shrub with edible leaves when well cooked in boiling water.  
     Seeman  mentions  this  was  eaten  with  yams,  or  cooked  in  soups.   sou  suggests  something  that  occurs  
    early.  S.  Savage  mentions  the  edible  fruits  shaped  like  very  small  papaya  with  a  pleasant  aromatic  
     smell, as used by maoris of eastern Polynesia.  
    •  boro  gaga  (or)  rokete  is  introduced,  hot  chilli  pepper,  Capsicum  frutescens,    (so-called  because  of  
     similarity  to  some  species of  Solanum genus in  their form of plant  and  shape of leaves).  Quite  a  few  
    Fijians now use chilli, in curry , in   
    tomato sauce, in a Tongan coconut-cream sauce called  miti for seafood, and on a salad-seaweed nama.   
    Idiom:  boro gaga reference to sarcastic, hurtful speech.

     take on highly varied coloration. Like the tree frog, it has no tadpole phase of growth, differing in this  
     from  the  introduced  toad,  or  many  frogs  in  other  lands.    Tiny  young  frogs  emerge  directly  from  the  
     large eggs. Neither frog is  equipped to live  in the water,  and the  skin membranes between the toes  are  
     minimal.  Unlike  the  tree  frog,  the  ground  frog has  no  adhesive  sucker pads  on  its  feet.  Both  types  of  
     frog were significant items in the diet of Viti Levu highlanders. Syn. dreli.     
boto    2.  n.  toad,  Bufo  marinus,  native  to  South  America,  introduced  from  Hawaii  in  1936  with  the

     nuisance.  Poison glands  at the  side of the neck repel potential enemies.  They exude  a while fluid that  
     can  seriously  irritate  human  skin.  They  are  ground  feeders,  very  probably  competing  with  the  Fiji

     made  commercially  of  fibreglass  with  more  rounded  bottom.  This  has  been  a  common  form  of  local  
     transport  on  major  rivers  and  at  seaside.  At  sea,  it  has  replaced  the  sailing  cutters  of  earlier  years,  
     having  the  advantage  of  an  engine.    In  deeper  river  areas  the  boto  has  replaced  some  of  the  bamboo  
     rafts bilibili.

    name  of  prominent  early  settler  from  Verata,  named  Buatavatava.    The  plant  has  mystical  but  
    undefined  significance  in  Fiji but  among  East  Polynesian  maoris,  the plant, known  as p ua,  has been

     known predator  is  the  triton  shellfish, Charonia tritonis,  all  too often collected  for  sale  to tourists,  and  
     thus now rare. This may explain explosive growth of bula populations in certain areas. Divers are paid

     into them to kill them.

    was  in  most  extremely  early  times  settled  and  greatly  disputed  by  Proto-Polynesians.  Part  of  their

     necessarily  to  be  thought  of  as  stealing  if  the  things  taken  are  not  being  used  immediately  by  the  
     “owner”  or  if  the  “owner” has  an  abundance.  Gathering  from  the  bush  or  nearby  vicinity has  always  
    been  a  major part  of  sub sistence  life.  Taking  from  one’s  widespread  set  of relatives  without  asking  is  
     considered  quite  normal.  The  notion  of personal possession  was  not  sacrosanct.  This  was  a  consumer  
     society  of  goods  that  were  almost  all  disposable  and  very  few  things  could  be  kept  personally  or  
    permanently  by  an  individual.    Taking  something  would  not  be  thought  of  a  stealing  if  it  would  not  
     greatly inconvenience the “owner”. On the other hand, Fijians can be angry if someone takes coconuts  
     or fruit from a tree they consider theirs. Looting of  salvaged goods, as from  a fire, flood, or shipwreck,

     new  husband’s  village  when  she  married.  For  practical  reasons,  this  is  not  often  the  case  in  these  
     modern times.  But  in formal terms,  a woman  “belongs” to the husband’s village  even if  she does not  
     actually live there.

     reckoned  on  the  visibility  of  giving,  which  may  prompt  a  Fijian  to  borrow  what  may  be  difficult  to  
     repay.  A  Fijian  will  be  shamed  for  giving  little,  especially  if  he  is  known  to  have  the  resources.  
     Anonymous  giving  would  be  rare  for  a  Fij ian.  Because  of  this  system,  it  is  difficult  for  a  Fijian  to  
     accumulate  personal  capital.  Even  if  he  does  accumulate  possessions  or  some  capital,  he  might  as  a

    remained  unmarried  till  age  at  least  28,  often  to  around  34.  Modernly,  marriage  is  occuring  much  
    younger for men.

    early  written  accounts  of  the usage  of  this  shell  as  a  revered presentation  item  and  none used  as  such  
    have been preserved in museums.

cavuikalawa  n.  progress, forward step, literally or figuratively. na imatai ni cavuikalawa  the first step of

icavuti   1.  n. title, name by which a person or group is identified, the (usually honorific) name by which a  
    kin-group is known or, less commonly, their plant, fish, or other animal.    
icavuti  2.  totem of  clan  (mataqali) or tribe  (yavusa) may be indicated by this word but properly, there is  
    no unique word for totem in Fij ian  languages. Only  a few kin-groups  are known by the name of their  
    totem  and  among  the  more  Melanesian  Viti  Levu  Fij ians  of highland  origin  it  is usually  forbidden  to  
    pronounce the name of the  totem. For this reason  icavuti is not  an  appropriate translation for the word  
     “totem”.  Mostly  among  Viti  Levu  highlanders  and  former  highlanders,  true  totems  exist  as  secret  
     symbols  of  the  people ’s  fertility  and  reproductive  capability  and  thus,  in  a  sense,  their  ability  to  
     survive.    Mere  mention  of  the  name  of  a  sacred  totem  could  formerly  have  drastic  consequences,  
     including  sexual  abuse,  stripping  and  dousing.  (These  days  one  might  be  splashed  with  water  and/or  
    required  to  drink  an  enormous  volume  of  yaqona  as  punishment.)  Many  if  not  most  of  Fij i’s  kin- 
     groups have no  sacred totems.  They do not  exist  in Lau , Burebesaga  (Rewa, Beqa, Kadavu), most of  
    LomaiViti beyond  Ovalau,  and  with perhap s rare  exceptions,  do  not  exist  in  Vanua  Levu,  Taveuni  or  
    Bau. They are conspicuouly  absent in areas of Polynesian influence. What Fijians may call their plant,  
    their fish or their bird is often a local distinction or feature for which they are known, or for which they  
    have  a high regard, or  some  thing  associated with their  ancestral  spirit that  can be  a  shark,  a dog, or  a  
     stone,  some  sand, or  a piece of water.  In one case, it  is  a  type of driftwood in the river. In  some cases  
    there  are  true  totems  with  reproductive  and  fertility  significance,  and  in  other  case  merely  iconic  
     features of importance in local custom  and tradition  and  sometimes, their tribal  spirit, kalou,  such  as  a  
     dog.    Unknowingly,  in  its  investigations,  the  Native  Lands  Commission,  persisted  in  demanding  to  
    know  the  local  totems  in  every  area  and  was  given  many  fanciful  answers  that  were  entered  into  
     official  records.    Similarly,  Fiji ’s  Education  Department  gathered  totemic  information  published  in  
     1984, and much of this is fanciful.   
icavucavuti (ni vosa)  n.  pronounciation, enunciation.  Syn. itautau ni vosa.  
icavu   1.  n .  a particular pleasure one takes in  something.  Not  a common word.  It may be a grand-child,

    jewelry, any added feature that makes the person more attractive.   
cavu  isausau   v.,  n.  refers  to  the  setting  of  a  new record,  as  in  sports  achievements.  The  term  originates  
     from  the  custom  of  pulling  up  (cavu)  the  marker  (isausau)  of  the  past  record  throw  of  the  obsolete  
    traditional sports j avelin (itiqa).

       Also  called  ilavo,  or  ilaf o  (from  the  Polynesian  name)  the  seeds  were  formerly  used  in  a  game  
     (veilavo), as counters to be flicked on a woven mat, knocking away another  seed. The huge coin-shape  
     of the seeds gave rise to the Fij ian word for money ilavo.    
       For  snack-food  called  revereve  in  Colo  East,  the  kernel  is  grilled,  sliced  thinly  and  added  to  wild  
     poisonous  yam  kaile  mila  (koile gaga  in  Colo  speech)  that has been  cooked  (these  days boiled),  then  
     grated into  a basin through which fresh water  flows.  The washing  and the  addition of  icibi offsets  the  
     irritating  (“itchy”  mila)  qualities  of  the  yam.  The resultant  mush  is hung  in  a  cloth  to  drain,  and  then  
     eaten. But first fruits must be formally presented to the chief at Nadakuni, for example.  The Waimaro  
     people  say  the  mash  tastes  like  ice  cream.    It  has  the  texture  of  mashed  potatoes  with  a  little  taste  
     added by the slices of icibi seeds.   
        Highlanders of Viti Levu made no oil for the body but they formerly chewed icibi  and rubbed that on  
     the skin for the oil content.    
       Children have used  icibi  for  the  detachable head  of  sporting j avelins used  in  their playful  version  of  
     the competitive game veitiqa, now obsolete.    
cibura  v. to fart and defecate at the same time.   
cici,  ciciva,  cicivaka      v .  to  run,  run  after,  run  to  (someone,  something).  cicivaka  to  run  with  (taking  
     something).  ciciva na p olo  to run for the ball.  ciciva yani na vale  run toward the house.  cicivaka na  
     cina  v. to run with the  lamp .  cicivaka na p olo  v. to run with the ball  (as in rugby).  Syn.  (Colo East)   
     dosi, dosive.  
icici  n.  anus (Vulgar: arse hole). Syn.  mata ni da, ivoco.   ci, civa (or) cita  v. to fart, to fart at (someone)  
cici levu!  vulgar insult: Big asshole !  
cici,  ciciga  (or)  cicia  (na  niu)    v.  to  cut  (as  of  copra).      na  cici  niu      the  copra-cutting.    Also  applied  to  
     extracting  the nut-flesh of  vutu  kana  (to be eaten), Barrigtonia  sp .  The motion is  that of  incision, then  
     scooping out,  as  in removing  coconut meat  from within the  coconut  shell with two or  three cuts, then  
     applied leverage with the knife.  There is considerable  skill involved to do this fast.   Cicia may be the  
     origin of the name of Cicia Island or it may be from  an ancient word for the Trochus  shell, now known  
     as sici.   
cicila   adj .  having unwanted holes, of clothes, pots, roof;  leaky.   
      Idiom:  bilo cicila  unreliable, not to be depended upon (of person), lit. leaky cup.   

                                                                   46

     who killed  the pet  fowl  Turukawa  of  Degei  at  Conua,  Nakauvadra.  They  were  expelled  and  departed

     LomaiViti,  all  areas of Tongan influence), who have recently come to Viti Levu  and  are often thought  
     to behave presumptuously.   Implication  is  that  they just  drifted  to  Viti  Levu  and  do  not belong  there;  
     they  are  not  "real  Fij ians"  (kaiViti  dina),  though  in  fact  a  great  number  of  them  had  originally  
     emigrated from Viti Levu. Syn. qalo mai.    
ciu, ciuva  v.  to stream out, as steam from a kettle, air from a punctured tyre.

civa    n.  pearl  oyster,  Pinctada  margaritifera  (Meleagrina  margeretifera),  edible.    mata  ni  civa    n.  pearl.  
     Fijians  traditionally  did  not  gather  or  treasure  pearls  or  any  other  gems,  though  white  cowry  shells  
     were  used  to  symbolize  power  and  chiefly  authority.  Pearlshell  came  to  be  used  in  breastplates  (see  
     civavonovono, below),  made by Tongans to be worn by Fij ian  chiefs. There  is no gold-lipped pearl  in  
     Fiji  and  pearls  are  rare  in  natural  black-lipped  pearl.  All  are  cultured  pearls.  In  the  1970s  a  Japanese  
     established  a  small  cultured  pearl  enterprise  on  the  coast  of  Ra.  Another  one  has  been  more  recently  
     established in Nasavusavu Bay, Vanua Levu, by Justin Hunter, and another has been planted at Malake  
     Island.  Seeded pearls  take  some three years  to mature  and  can  live  for ten to twelve years.  Harvest is  
     usually  in  March  and  August.  Very  large,  delicious  rock  oysters  from  Sydney  were  introduced  to  
     Mago  Island  long  ago.  Fiji  also has  a  small  mangrove  oyster,  or rock  oyster  dio,   Ostrea  sp.,  not  now  
     usually eaten. (They are small and hard to open.)   
civaciva   n. species of small pearl oyster, Pinctada martensi, often eaten. Near a Vanua Balavu village one  
     may see piles of discarded shells.  
civa vonovono  n. (Archaic)  round breast-plate of black-lip pearlshell, often with some  strips or pieces of  
     whaletooth,  made  by  Tongans.    In  Tonga  there  had  been  the  notion  that  a  breast-plate  might  impede  
     the  arrows of Fijians.   (Tongans  themselves traditionally used bows  and  arrows only for  chiefly  sport,  
     not  in  war.)    Bau  gave  some  of  these  breast-plates  to  Viti  Levu  chiefs  who  co-operated  in  accepting  
     Christianity and Bauan leadership . Syn. bulutoko also referring to breast-plates.  
civedre v.  to roll or turn up the eyeballs,  showing fatigue, unconsiousness, or impending death, or just  as  
     a gesture of boredom, or exasperation.  Syn. civele.    
civi, civia or civita  v. to peel, pare, or chip off the skin (raw yams, taro, cassava; fruit such  as wi). civicivi   
     peelings. Chipping or carving more deeply into the  substance would be ceuta.   See  also sivi, sivita for  
     a chipping action that would give shape, as to a club or spear, or even a pencil being sharpened.     
civicivi  (ni  yaqona)    n.    peelings  and  chipped  pieces  of  sun-dried  kava  rhizome  (lewena).  The  skin  is  
     removed only in areas of Tongan influence (Lau, Cakaudrove, Kadavu) to make a whiter beverage that  
     is  less  bitter,  which  is  then  preferred  by  Polynesians.    The  peelings  are  used  to  adulterate  powdered  
     kava  sold  in the market. They  add  a bitterness  and unpleasant  taste.  This  skin was used by European  
     manufacturers of neutraceutical kava  as  a  source of kavalactones  and that may explain  to toxicity  that  
     resulted in a ban on those pills.  
vakacivo  v.  to express  a wish  after  spitting out  a light  spray of the dregs from  a  cup of yaqona. Usually  
     the individual’s wish is for  fair weather, good crops, good health.  These days,  spitting is less  common  

                                                                  48

co,  cova   v.   to  swoop down, plunging,  of  a predatious bird,  to  catch  its  food  at  the  ground  (rat,  chicken,  
    lizard) or water (small fish), or pounce as a cat might do in catching a mouse.   Cocova!  Go for it !  
Coba!  exclamation when a target is hit.   
coba, cobara, cobaraka   v. to stick a sharp obj ect into something, where it will stay, nail in wood, a stake  
     or fence-post in the ground, do up buttons on shirt.  vakacobara na ivako  to nail, hit the nail.  Ni viri e  
    dua  na  toro,  e  na  cobacoba  wavoki  na  kau.    When  a  pig-stye  is  set  up,    sticks  will  be  stuck  in  the

cobo, cobota  v., n . to perform  a ritually respectful or  politely  appreciative gesture,  clapping one's hands  
     across  each  other  (not  parallel),  to  make  a  deep ,  resounding  noise.  cobota  na  vulagi  dokai    clap  
    resoundingly for the honoured visitor.  vakacobocobo   ritual performance of  such clapping.  cobo bitu    
     in dance music, using  a  section of bamboo  (bitu), to hit  the ground rhythmically with  the open end  to  
    maintain  a resounding beat. (In many parts of Fiji this was in early times the only musical instrument.)    
    derua is an  alternate word for bamboo used in this way, though more exactly derua refers to the round  
     and    smooth  surface  of  the  internal  closure  at  the  internode  of  bamboo.  (Thus  the  term  derua  is  also  
    used  mockingly  for  a  man ’s bald pate,  when  no hair  grows  on his head.)  A  ivakacobocobo   n.  ritual  
     clapping  of  thanks,  as  traditionally  done  by  hosts  at  the  end  of  an  isevusevu    ceremony,  receiving  a  
    presentation of yaqona.  The cobo these days is most often heard  after  a person has  consumed  a bowl  
     of kava, clapped three times, or in Kadavu, that can be five times.  Older Fij ians may still cobo to show  
     appreciation  for  some  act  or  gift,  instead  of  saying  words  of  thanks,  such  as  vinaka,  which  is  modern  
     custom.    In  rural  areas,  people  may  cobo  for  a  chief  who  has  finished  eating  a  meal.  Formerly,  they  
    might  cobo  “after  a  chief had  spoken,  after he had belched  (nderekonataka)  or broken  wind  (thi)  .  .  .   
    before someone spoke to him and after speaking to him.” (Roth, Fij ian Way of  Lif e, p. 95.)  
cobo    (Colo)  n.    ass-hole  (vulgar).  It  is  because  of  this  local  meaning  that  people  of  Colo  highlands  use  
     'obo    for  the  Bauan  cobo,  to  indicate  the  ritual  of  appreciative  clapping  of  the  cupped  hands.  (The  
     clapping  of  the  hands  held  parallel  and  flat  is  quite  different,  done  to  indicate  applause,  a  custom  
     adopted from Europeans.)  
cobo,  cobora   1.   v.  to  cover, usually  a plate  or bowl  of  food, using  another plate,  or  to  cover  something  
    being dried in the sun (yaqona or pandanus leaf), placing a sheet of tin on top to protect from the rain.  
cobo, cobora  2.  v. turn upside-down, plate, cup, saucepan, pot, box.   
coci  n. hare-lip, as in gusu coci   cleft palate.  
coco  v.  to fall down forwards. Syn. colovu.

     abominably  in  Fij i  with  little respect  for  Fijian  custom.   For  many  of  them,  Christianity  was  a  facade  
    they used in dominating Fij ians.  
      Idiom:    curumi  tevoro    “possessed”  by  a  spirit,  common  occurence,  body  thrashing  about,  shouting,  
    out  of  control,  not  conscious  of  one’s  words  or  actions.  The  tevoro has  “entered”  the person  and  may  
     speak  through  the  person,  using  that  body  as  a  vehicle  (waqawaqa),  as  a  presence.  In  handling  such  
    cases,  one  tries  to  control  the  victim ’s  movements  and  shout  at  him/her  literally  to  eat  the  spirit  
     (Kania!).  This whole event may be a form of psychological release in a traditionally highly controlled  
     society .  A  person  may  not  be  held  responsible  for  what  is  said  or  done  while  possessed  by  a  devil.   
    People  in  attendance  may  throw  food,  such  as  pieces  of  taro,  at  the  victim,  or  spit  on  them  to  help  
    exorcise the devil.  Syn.  (Rewa) ruku, rukuta  to enter a person (of a devil).   
      Idiom:    curu  vale    v .  to  abscond  with  someone  else’s  spouse,    usually  said  of  a  man  taking  another  
    man ’s wife or simply taking in a mistress.   
      Idiom:   tamata curu-suka   repeating offender who is repeatedly in  and out of prison, but may refer to  
     someone who repeatedly goes in and out of some place such as a medical clinic or hospital.

dabea  n. moray, conger eel, Gymnothorax undutus or Lycodontis j avanicus in Ika ni  Waitui,  as published  
     by the Institute of Fijian Language  and Culture.  Can be large, up to an unusual three meters long, with  
     no  scales  and  no  fins.    In  Rewa  sometimes  referred  to jokingly  as  “saltwater  pork”    vuaka  ni  waitui,  
     because Rewa has so few wild pigs. The dabea flesh is eaten but not prized. Sacs of poison at the neck  
     must  be  removed.    There  are  some  reefs,  as  at  Mago  Island,  that  are  virtually  infested  with  this  eel.  
     Very dangerous if  attacked or feels threatened.   It does not go out  of its way  to  attack people but will  
     attack very  swiftly  if imposed upon in its territory.  Of camouflaged colour,  and often keeping  still, it  
     may  not  be  observed  by  the  diver.  Strangely,  this  predator  has  two  sets  of j aws,  one  set  in  front  that  
     grasp s its victim, then a  second set, the pharyngeal j aws that advance to force it back into the throat, to  
     the  esophagus.  Unlike  most  fish predators,  the  moray  does  not  use  suction  to  consume  its prey.  (De- 
     tails published by Drs.  Mehta  and Wainwright in Nature, 2007). Its  flexible,  multiple j aws  allow it  to  
     consume  large  fish.  It holds its grip , not having to bite twice.  More dangerous than the moray bite is  
     the  very  deadly poisonous  nature  of  moray  flesh  due  to  “red  tide”  ar  certain places  and  certain  times,  
     more deadly than any fish.  
dabi    n.  puzzlenut  tree,  Xylocarpus  granatum,  Meliaceae,  30  to  60  feet,  growing  around  mangrove.  Big  
     round  fruit  is  poisonous.  Bark  is  brown,  smooth,  and  almost  shiny  white  in  places,  used  for  red  dye.   
     An  infusion  of  the  bark  is  drunk  as  a  remedy  for  thrush  macake,  a  fungus  infecting  the  tongue  and  
     mouth.  Rind  of  the  nut  makes  black  dye.    As  the  name  implies,  the  nut  separates  into  segments  that  
     seem impossible to assemble back together. Syn. (Lau) leqi. (West)  leqileqi. (Nadro.)  lokoloko.  
dabibi  n. heavy wet mud in mangrove swamps, riverside or on flats where washed down by rain, or flood.   
     It  can  later  become  fine-grained  alluvial  loam  when  dry,  not  clumpy  like  clay  soil.  It  is  also  the  soft

dani   n.  fairly  common  whitish  discoloration, pale blotches  on  a person's  skin  caused by  a  fungus,  Tinia  
    versicolor.  Most  often    treated  medically  with  salicylic  acid.  Selenium  sulfide  (often  found  in  anti- 
    dandruff shampoos) is also useful in modern treatment.   
dania  (Hindi  dhaniya)    n.  coriander,  Coriandrum  sativum,  herbal  spice  used  by  Indians  for  the  bitter- 
    tasting fresh leaves, and also, quite separately, for the bland dried  seeds that makes up as much as 25%  
    of  curry  powder.    Urban  Fij ians  often  eat  curry  and  buy  prepared  curry  powder.  Only  rarely  would  
     some Fij ians use coriander directly.   
danidani    n.  plant,  Polyscias  spp.,  Aralaceae,  commonly  grown  near  houses,  small  yellow  leaf,  leaves

    large  sardine.  Best cooked over  an open fire. Delicious flavour.  Some Fij ians in the West have devel- 
    oped  the  skill  of  putting  the  whole  cooked  fish  in  their  mouths,  removing  the  bones  by  tongue  and  
    mouth movement, and spitting out the bones intact. Around Nasavusavu, this fish (and the  smaller sar- 
    dine-type  fish  called  sara)  are  rather  used  as  bait.  Schools  may  be  fished  with  double  hooks  without  
    bait,  snaring the fish by chance.When daniva  are chased by larger predators, they fling themselves out  
    of  the  water,  often  landing  on  the beach.  Clupeioid poisoning, particularly  from  the  viscera,  may kill  
    on consumption, especially October through February . Also, deadly poisonous daniva may result from  
    explosions, as of dynamite blasting around a reef or from hurricane damage of a reef.   
danoto  adj .  soft, spongy, as of  a cake or  a pillow, but  springing back when pressed as plastic foam would

    yaqona has been formally prepared, and ready to be served.  
darava  (Nait.,  Lom.,  Verata)    n.    doorway,  entrance.  Swinging  doors  never  existed  in  ancient  Fij i.  En- 
    trances  were  closed,  especially  at  night, by  some  covering  such  as  matting  or  a plaque  of  interwoven  
    palm leaves.  A house has two doorways, one  at the bottom end where cooking was done  and less im- 
    portant  people  could  enter,  na  darava  i  sue,  and  a  more  formal  entrance  at  the  side  where  important  
    people would enter, na darava levu. In fact, this was  a development in Colonial times. Originally there

     archal system of indirect rule.  Spelling may vary.

     broom.)

    ing  to  Rob  Wright),  or  grey  snapper,  Lethrinella  mineatus  (or  perhaps  L.  xanthocheila),  similar  to  a  
    sabutu,  upper  parts  faded  yellow,  striped  blue/green  mouth,  often  found  around  reef  entrances,  but  
     some  times  at  some places  dangerous  to  eat because  of  ciguatera  (red  tide) poisons  in  the  food-chain.  
    The  curious  name possibly  derives  from  the  shape  as  seen by  early  Fijians  (and rather  implied by  the  
    Fijian name) rather like an improvised  support for  a fruit-heavy plantain “tree”, pointed at one end and  
    deeply forked at the other. (P . Geraghty suggested this derivation.) Syn. kacika.   
doko ulu   v. to dive head-first (as into water) or simply head for some other place.

    ciprocal  gift.      veidolei        repayment  (as  a  concept).    In  most  places  of  Fiji,  for  example  (but  not  at  
    Udu), it is customary for hosts to reciprocate the  isevusevu of yaqona presented by visitors introducing  
    themselves  and their purpose. Reciprocity has been  an essential aspect of Fijian culture. In  some cases  
    it  can be  a return  favour  for  what has been  obtained by  kerekere  requests.   Traditionally, but perhaps  

                                                               68

     (1993)  by  its  President,  Sitiveni  Gusuivalu  who  lived  at  village  Tacirua,  near  Suva  and  claimed  a  
     membership of 2000.  Members often dress distinctively, the men in white gowns  and the women in  a  
     white  dress  with  a  red  sulu  showing below  the  dress.  There  are  36  male preachers but  leadership has  
     been totally  autocratic,  including choice of the  script of teaching.  Meetings  are held in private homes.

     countable for its  funds But then neither has  the Church of the Poor. A breakaway branch is  said to  al-

     Most Fijians themselves eat only the sandfish dairo, usually raw. This species and other types they sell  
     to  Chinese  traders  for  export.  Named  other  species  include:   sucuwalu  (H.  fuscogilva,  dark brown  or  
     creamy white, sometimes with blotches,  all covered with sand, with eight nipple-type nodules), green- 
     fish (lokoloko ni qio),  loaloa (H. whitmaei), dri loa, dri damu (reddish brown), tarase (brown, Actino-

     prickles  all  over  its body)  and  dri  vula  (Bohadschia  sp.).   Noting  that  tiny  fish  come  out  from  the  dri  
     vula,  some Fij ians believe that this  sea cucumber is giving birth to  ika sa which later becomes  a fairly  
     big fish that they catch  and eat.  Some  say the dri vula is mother to the moray-like eel  called  tunatuna.

     ted, cleaned, cut into pieces  and wrapped in plantain leaves.  That is left to rot for four nights. It  stinks

     Idiom:    volitaki  dri    n.    (Slang)  prostitute,  volitaka  dri  v.  to  go  around  as  a  prostitute.  Implication  is  
     from the notion that  a woman ’s private parts may be  symbolized by  a  sea  cucumber. Literally the ref- 
     erence is to sell (volitaka) sea cucumber.   
     Idiom:    volitaki  kai  koso  same  meaning  as  above,  implying  a  resemblance  of  the  kai  koso  shellfish  
     (Arca sp.) with a woman ’s private parts.

     1850.   European  ship s  sold  in  Manila  for  the  market  in  China  and  the  ships  returned home  with  silk,  
     tea and sugar. A minor trade continues today on a modest  scale, individual Fij ians diving and selling to  
     Chinese merchants who export it.

     youngsters  are  often  favoured.    Dark-skinned  indigenous  Fijians  often  originally  accepted  light- 
     skinned Polynesian  (and  sometimes Europeans)  as their chieftains  and  ancestral  spirits.  However, Dri  
     loa has been a proud reference to Viti Levu highlanders of super-tribe Waimaro, feared warriors, dark-

drimi   n.  a  certain itchy, fungal  affliction of  the  skin with pimples or blisters,  sometimes  said to be ring-

     witchcraft,  in  which  case  it  can  be  fatal.    E  dua  e  cakava  tiko  na  kemu  drimi.      Someone  is  causing  
     your  drimi  illness.  Natively,  virtually  all  illness  was  thought  to be  caused by  someone  casting  a  spell  
     and  that  notion persists  still  today.  Fij ians  often believe  that  European  medicine  is  ineffectual  against  
     drimi  and a few other “Fij ian sicknesses” (tauvimate vakaViti) such as raberabe,  and sau.  Some of the  
    problems might be psychogenic.  Syn. drimu.  See baubau.

    Now there are some gifted graphic artists.   idrodroini  n. graphic arts.

    green  (uncured)  of  firewood,  timber.   Modern  tendency  is  to use  this  word  for  anything  green  as per- 
    ceived by Europeans, if it were  an  ab stract  colour defined  as part of the colour  sprectrum.  Fijians had  
    not  developed  the  notion  of  abstract  colours  as  such.  Their  names  of  colours  were  always  associated

    ing  the  meat  as  an  improvised  meal.  The  water  is  still  drinkable,  not  so  laxative  as  water  of  the  com-

drolo adj .  very muddy, especially of watery mud.  Syn. drodrolu, soso; words based on lobo refer to very  
     sticky mud. The word Drola was used for the name of a coastal bay of Nacula Island in the far west of  
    Fiji,  and  it  implies  murky  water,  there  caused by brown  algae.  Here  a branch  of  super-tribe  Vusaratu  
     settled  and call  their  chief the Tui Drola  and Drola became  the name of their tribe.  Closely related  is  
    the  word  and  notion  of  a  snake  god  named  Tui  Drolo,  of  the  Colo  East highlands  of  super-tribe Wai- 
    maro. He is the  ancestral spirit (kalou vu) of clan Nakorovatu, tribe Waimaro, who have resided at vil- 
    lages Nakorosule and Nakida. Fact is quite probably that this  snake is the eel known as dadarikai, that  
    inhabits  such  sloshy mud. Highlanders using the title Tui indicates  an earlier close contact with Verata  
     and Tongan influence. Tongans did use Viti Levu highlanders  as  mercenary  warriors,  slaves,  and col- 
    lectors  of  red  kula  feathers  for  trade  to  Samoa.    There  is  a  village  Vaimaro  (=  Waimaro)  in  Vava’u,

     ginger family.   
drove  2.  (Cakau . & Nadro.) n. a native ginger, Zingiber  sp.  In different parts of Fij i, different species of  
     ginger  bear  this  name.    One  of  the  main  species  bearing  this  name  is  Geanthus  cevuga,  a  tall  ginger

    ing his home territory.  In fact, practically no Fijian tribe has ever lived for  any great length of time in

    Polynesian.  Ramacake  was  legendary player  on  Makogai  Island  whose  music  attracted  the  women  of  
    Bau. They looked for him in LomaiViti,  and he, being very  shy, misdirected them to  avoid them  find- 
    ing him. He thought himself ugly, possibly due to leprosy.

dumudumu-kuro    n.  edible j ellyfish.  It  is  boiled,  Netrostoma  sp.    Syn.  drose.  (Note  that Na  iVolavosa  
     VakaViti, page  148, considers dumudumu-kuro  distinct from  drose and, unlike drose, not eaten.  
duna    n.  river  eel.    Three  main  types  are  the  diria  (clear-water  eel),  the  badamu  (mud  eel),  and  the  
     tautaubale  (rock  eel).  There  is  also  a  moray  eel  in  the  rivers,  that  is  not usually  eaten,  and has  a  very  
     nasty bite;  see dararikai,  above.  laki  ta duna  go catching eels.  They are caught by hand, or by hand- 
     net,  or  light  fishing  line.  Bait used  is  a  shelled  shrimp  or  tiny  fish  (its  natural  food),  or  guts  from  an- 
     other  eel ;  worms  may  be  used  in  daytime.    With  a  line,  one  patiently  lets  the  eel  swallow  the  bait  
     deeply, then pulls it in easily. The eel is subdued by hitting or cutting its tail, not its head, for the tail is  
     the motive force.  In catching by hand, the fingers  are inserted into the gills, or directly into the mouth,  
    pushing in hard. To attempt to pull out the finger too soon results in a very painful, injured finger.  The  
     eel's teeth  are deeply raspy  (not like  a  snake's)  and  are very effective  at removing  skin painfully.  Eels  
     are edible, but in some  areas of the mainland it is an aquatic totem, and is not eaten.  Eels breed in the  
     sea,  the  young  transformed  into  transparent  “glass  eels”  when  they  encounter  fresh  water,  become  
     darker  in  colour  and,  known  in  English  as  elvers,  they  migrate  upstream  in  the  rivers,  even  against  
     forceful currents.  (The migration is described by Paddy Ryan,  author of Fij i ’s Natural Heritage.)  Syn.  
     (West)  tuna.

     "husks"), yields twice  a year,  around March or April  and again in November.  The fruits of red duruka  
     are  smaller  and in texture  are drier  than white duruka . Duruka  is perhaps best  cooked by grilling over

     censis. The poisoned fish are perfectly edible. They float to the surface. Curiously , crustaceans  are not  
     affected by  the poison.   The poison  itself  is  fatal  to human  if  consumed,  as  evidenced by  a  case  of  a  
     suicide. Leaves are also macerated and used to heal wounds, applied externally .  vakaduva na wai  poi- 
     son  the  water  (with  duva).     By  extension,  duva   can  refer  to black  magic:  Kemu  duva  sa  caka  tiko.   
     Black magic is being made  against you.   Modernly, Fijians may use dangerous  agricultural  chemicals  
     (often stolen) to poison fish and prawns that they sell by the side of the road.    
duva, duvana   v. to  apply poison deliberately, either to fish  (see  above) or humans.  duvani poisoned, of  
     fish or humans. Poison for humans was usually mixed in with yaqona to be drunk by the unsuspecting  
     victim.  Poisons used included the duva kalou, Pittosporum, five  species, fish poisons,  and in the Nai- 
     tasiri highlands,  lobau  Brugmansia  suevolens, poison  for humans,  these  days  more  commonly known  
     as davui or Angel ’s trumpet, introduced  shrub closely related to Datura, Jimson weed,  a known intoxi- 
     cant. Also mavu ni Toga, again  a human poison, Antiaris toxicaria, Moraceae,  a not very common tree  
     with bright  crimson flowers. I have noted it in Tailevu, perhaps  an  introduction via Tonga. This taxon  
     has provided  many  of  the poisons used  for  centuries  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  Fiji  variety  is  somewhat  
     less toxic than some of the Asian ones.  In Fiji  a poison would only have to disable  a person. A club to  
     the head could finish the job.      
duvu  n.  uterus, womb. Syn. kato ni gone.   
duvu lutu  n. Fijian medical problem of women when the womb has  seemed to descend.  This is  adjusted  
     manually by an older woman,  and is often done while the patient is seated in water.  One uses the verb  
     sili for this action, as if bathing.  Sa tarai na nona duvu.  Her  uterus has been manipulated.    
duvu  as used in vuniduvu,  this refers to a composer of traditional exhibition dances (meke). This is a very  
     presitigious  position.  People  formally  request  the  composer  to  compose  a  meke  for  them.    He  com- 
     poses,  trains  those  people,  and  then  transmits  it  so  that  it  “belongs”  to  that  group.    No  other  people  
     should perform that meke without persmission. The composer is well rewarded.  Syn. daunivucu.

     an official grammarian insists on joining the e with the na. Actual custom varies greatly.  
e   6.  particle in front of pronouns especially when the pronoun is the subj ect of the sentence, or begins the  
     sentence,  as  in:    e  ratou  =  eratou,    e  ra  =  era.  Properly  this  e  should  be  attached,  not  separated,  
     according to the modern rules imposed by Cabinet decision.

     usually  intended  for  formal  occasions  including  church  services.  It  is  customary  to  use  worn  or  
     somewhat  torn  matting,  to  give  a  sense  of humility.  This  is  not  worn  in  the  Moala  Region  (Yasayasa  
     Moala),  part  of  Lau  Province,  and  not  in  some  parts  of  northern  Lau  Province  that  are  more  closely

     water into  the  mouth, the pot being held  several inches  above. Lip s never touched the drinking vessel

      In ancient times Fij ians used at least three species of plant as poisons to be consumed by their enemies.  
     Duva  kalou,  Pittosporum  sp.,  Pittosporaceae,  was  pounded  and  mixed  in  yaqona  (Capell,  p.  64);   
     lobau,  Brugsmansia  suaveolens  (formerly  Datura  candida),  also  mixed  in  yaqona  in  Colo  East  as  I  
     have  recorded  in  oral  histories;    and  mavu  ni  toga,  Antiaris  toxicaria,  Moraceae,  for  which  I  have  
     insufficient  information  on how  it  was used.  Antiaris  spp. have  long been used  in  Asia  as  a poison  to  
     kill  humans.    Apparently  Fij ians  did  not  usually  use  poison  on  their  arrows  or  spears.  Used  as  an  
     abortifacient  were  colourful  (bright  red  and  stark black)  seeds  of  diridamu,  Abrus precatorius, but  its  
     deadly  cyanide  often  killed  the  mother  as  well  as  the  foetus.    Formerly,  diridamu  were  used  in  
     necklaces,  now  forbidden  due  to  the  dangerous poison.  So  small  and  quick-acting,  diridamu has been  
     used in food for assassinations.  
gaga  adj .  to be sitting idly, not knowing what needs to be done.   

                                                                85

     slack  about  the  body.  Sa  galala  tu  na  nomu  tarusese.    Your  pants  are  loose  (too  big).  Colonial  
     authorities  established  a  system  whereby  a  Fijian  individual  or  nuclear  family  could be released  from  
     village  and  clan  responsibilites  to  be  independent  (galala).    Although  Ratu  Sukuna  himself  lived  
     independently of  any  clan or village responsibilities, he discouraged that  system  for Fij ians generally,  
     believing they were not ready for it. The system failed partly because independent Fijians usually lived  
     close to their village, and villagers by custom would not release them from traditional obligations.

     on  the  ground,  a  couple  of  dozen  babies  at  a  time,  preferably  in  a  damp  place.  Most  of  the  day  is  
     motionless, high in the treetops,  so most Fijians have never  seen one.  (Many Fijians these days live in  
     the cities, towns or suburb s.) The diet is lizards, rats, flying foxes  (fruit bats), birds. A common length  
     is one  meter but  the boa  can grow to  two meters. Locally,  the boa has  its   colour variations which led  
     people  to  think  there  were  several  species,  and  the  personality  can  become  a  quite  snappy  in  some

     places, Kabara, for example.   Males have tiny vestigial  claspers or  spurs  around the  cloaca. Formerly,  
     necklaces were sometimes made of the snake’s  back-bones. Modernly, Fijians might generally refer to  
     all or any snakes as gata.  In Fij i there are no venemous land snakes that ever bite people. The small, to  
     15 inch bolo, Ogmodon vitiensis, is deadly poisonous but is  shy, very rarely  seen,  and has never been  
     known  to  bite  anyone.  The  boa  was  eaten  in  Taveuni,  Ovalau,  Namosi,  and  Kadavu  and  in  the  
     highlands  of  Viti  Levu  (Namosi  and  Colo  East)  and probably  other places.  Tavuki people  of  Taveuni  
     bred  snakes  for  the  Tui  Cakau  to  eat.  In  some  places  the  snake  is  sacred,  and  may  be  a  totem.  At  
     village Somosomo on Taveuni Island it has had ritual significance. Similarly on Kadavu Island, village  
     Naikorokoro,  Sanima  District,  tribe  Suesue,  there has been  great ritual  significance  to  the  snake;  they  
     kept a bai ni gata, snake pit in a pile of rocks, and practised ceremonies that revitalised the people.   
            Reverance  for  the  snake  brings  up  a  connection  between  the  Vusaratu  people  of  Nacula  Island  
     and  those  Colo  East highlanders  of  tribe  Nakorovatu  who have revered  a  snake-god  called  Tui  Drolo  
     where drolo refers to murky  or muddy water. Nacula’s Vusaratu people opted to become Tribe Drola  
     (sic)  which  again  refers  to  murky  waters  (from  algae)  of  the  bay  where  they  arrived  and  settled.  
     Nothing  more  is known  of  their  old relationship.   It  is  well known  that  the  ancestral  god  Degei  takes  
     the  form  of  a  snake  at  the  Nakauvadra  mountain range  in  northern  Viti  Levu.  His  movements  turning  
     over his body in  a cave explain  any thunder that is heard but he is  quite inoffensive, little interested in  
     human  affairs,  if  at  all.  Degei  was  the  name  of  a  legendary  immigrant  chief,  later  deified.  Some  oral  
     history refers to Degei I and Degei II.  Syn. (Colo East, Namosi) balei.   
gato  1.  n.  glottal  stop  that  in  pronunciation  replaces  the  t  in  parts  of  Ra  and  western  Vanua  Levu,  and

     gatotaki na k mai Bua.  The letter k is replaced with  a glottal  stop in Bua.  In  some Vanua Levu  areas  
     both  the  t  and  the  k  are  replaced by  glottal  stops;  this  is  referred  to  as gato  rua,  another   term  newly  
     invented by school teachers.

     often, darker colouring.

     Idiom:      gau  kau      beat  someone  with  a  stick.    In jocular j ibing  with  a  person  from  Gau  Island,  one  
     hears  the  term  Gau  kau  that  calls  to  mind  the  supposedly  great power  of  the  Gau people.  In  fact,  that  
     power has been more imaginary than real.  The expression usually raises a smile.

Gaunavou    n.  “New  Era”,  a  name  adopted  by  Apolosi  R.  Nawai  (ca.  1877-1946)  renegade  political  
     dissident, to express the importance of his indigenous movement. He first formed an association called  
     Soqosoqo ni Gauna  Vou. His commercial enterprise Viti Kabani “Fiji Company” collap sed  and he was  
     detained  by  government  authorities  at  the  instance  of  Ratu  Sukuna  who  had  him  deported  to  New  
     Zealand,  and then  exiled,  first  to Yacata Island, later to die  at Yanuca  Island  (just off Qamea  Island).   
     He had led a flamboyant personal life and had a large following as  a  sort of indigenous prophet. Some  
     of  his  conceptual  ideas  had  been  good  and  constructive  but  his  own  self-interest,  opposition  to  
     government,  flamboyant  life-style  and  cavalier  mis-management  led  to  his  own  failure.    The  word  
     Gaunavou  is  still  occasionally  used  by  Fijians  for  some  new  venture,  more  mundane  than  Nawai ’s  
     vision.   
gauniliga-na n.  forearm (human).   
gaunisala  1.  n. road. See sala  path.

     bilo referred just to human knee-caps.  
veivagunuvi  n. installation of  a chief  (by having him drink the ceremonial cup of kava offered), a custom

     scales  and  tough  skin, guru  is usually  grilled  on  a  fire  and  then  skinned.  Dorsal  spines  make  the  fish

                                                                     I  
     The  letter  i  is pronounced rather  more  like  the  double  e  in  English ,  as  in  queen,  and  less usually  like  
the i in the word  city.  
     Quite a few noun-forms begin with the letter i when the noun-form is adapted from  a verbal root-form.  
Thus the word for  "the knife" na isele  is  adapted from the verb “to cut” sele, seleva. By Cabinet dictum in  
March 2008, that  i  should be  attached  as part of the noun-form.  Nonetheless, in much common writing in  
Fiji,  the  word  can  often  still  be  seen  as  nai  sele  or  na  isele.  In  this  dictionary  that  word  would  appear  
alphabetically under  the  letter  s,  first  letter  of  the root-word  sele.   In  ordinary,  fast  speech,  one  might  not  
always hear the letter i that precedes many nouns.    
                                                    
i   1.  of, an abbreviation of ni as in:  tama i Seru   father of Seru .    
i  2.  to (or) to the, an abbrev. of ki or ki na.  siro sobu ki matasawa  go down to the beachfront.   
i    3.  alternative,  regional  pronounciation  for  the  prefix  “e”  in  word  combinations  helping  to  indicate  
     direction.  i ra, ira or e ra  below (or downwind).  i cake (or) e cake  above (or upwind)  .  Those words  
     sometimes used as a suffix to a place-name, as in Nananu-ira Island.   
i  4.  an  attached prefix that indicates a noun adapted from  a verbal root-form :   isele   knife  (from the verb  
     “cut” sele);    idabedabe    seat,  chair,  saddle  (from the verb  “to  sit” dabe).   Some Fijians prefer to  see  
     that “i” float alone, unattached to the noun.  
ia  1.  v. to go.  Ia mai!   Come here !  ia i Suva   go to Suva.  Syn. lako. (Vanua Levu) la ’o.    
ia   2.  word that stands alone, indicating a pause, meaning “Well,  .  . .”   
Ia ! 3.  said rather forcefully, this can be the equivalent of “Hey, you !”, catching a person ’s attention.   
ia   4. (or) ia ka  but, used as  a conjunction (isema) in  a  sentence.  Au via  lako  ia sa sega ni rawa.  I want  
     to go but it is not possible.

     place.  iataka na meke  to perform the exhibition-dance.

     (kula).      ibe  kilukilu    course-woven  floor  mat  (kilu  refers  to  the  plain  finishing  edge  with  no  fringe).   
     kiluvatu is  a type of mat unique to Udu, Macuata Province, having no fringe but  a very  strong,  straight  
     edge.   ibe vakabati  mat with  several layers of wool  fringe for  covering  a bed.  bati ni vasua mat with

ika bula  n. sea turtle, any kind.  May also refer to a live fish.  
ika loa  n.   a kind of mullet, Cestraeus  sp.,  a  significant  source of food from rivers. Viti Levu highlanders  
     caught these in community efforts with large nets, using  stone  sinkers,  and divers  to guide the net  and  
     drive  the  fish.  These  stone  sinkers  (vatu-kata-i-lawa)  were  the  only  stone  implements  ever  used  by  
     highlanders.  
ika ni laca  n. sailfish , long-beaked with a huge dorsal fin, the usually migratory Istiophorus  sp.,  rarely if  
     ever  caught  by  early  Fijians  but  now  available  as  people  now  fish  outside  the  reefs.  The  flesh  is  not  
     preferred,  partly  because  of  the  frequently  found  holes  in  the  flesh  caused  by  parasitical  worms.   
     Normally  darkish  coloured,  sailfish  skin  sparkles  with  colour  and  glistening  silver  when  the  fish  is  
     excited. They travel  in  small groups but can come together in  large groups, male  and female together,  
     to  herd  small,  schooling  sardine-like  fish  into  ball  shapes,  circling  them,  then  individually  penetrate  
     that school with thrashing beak to stun the smaller fish, ultimately consuming almost all of them.  
ika  toa  1.  (or)  ikatotoa  (or)  tokalou   lion  fish, butterfly  fish,  Lactoria  cornuta,  formerly  listed  as  Pterois

iloilo  n.  mirror,  glass.    mata  iloilo  spectacles,  glasses.    vaka-rai-ta-iloilo      n.  imagination.      vaka-rai-ta- 
     iloilo-taka    v.  to  imagine  it.   The  only kind  of  mirror known  in  Fiji  was  a  reflection  in  clear pool  of  
     water. Such a mirror gives rise to the name of Ratu Sir Joseva Iloilo (he told me) from his mother ’s use  
     of such a natural mirror on Taveuni.  
ilova  v.  look  at,  through  something  transparent  (glasses,  diving  goggles,  translucent  or  reflective  like  a

io    yes.    Traditionally,  Fij ians  answered  questions  with  strict  logic,  as  in  “Aren ’t  you  going  to  town?”  
     responding  with  a  “Yes”,  meaning  “Yes,  I  am  not  going  to  town .”  Today  usage  is  confusing.  Only  
     conservative  village  Fij ians  can  be  relied  upon  to  retain  the  correct  Fij ian  logic.  Often,  instead  of  
     giving  a  verbal  answer  “yes”,  Fij ians  will  raise  their  brow  slightly  (deguvacu),  or  they  may  simply  
     raise the chin to indicate  agreement. Instead of saying “no” in declining a request,  a Fijian may remain  
     silent. In effect,  a silent response means “no”.  It might be considered impolite to say “no”. A negative  
     response  may  be  indicated  by  a  slight  sideways  movement  of  the  head.    vaka-io    v.  to  say  “yes”,  to  
     approve, to agree. Syn. (Tonga)  ’io.

     large  fan  in  battle  confrontations  as  an  indication  of  fearlessness  and  display  of  confidence.  (Ligairi

     from  plantain  by  its  fragile  leaf  that  tears  more  easily  in  the  wind,  and  by  its  more  acute  form.  It  is  
     more  susceptible  to  disease  than  is  plantain.    Early  native  immigrants  brought  several  varieties  of  
     plantain  but  no  bananas  which  are  much  sweeter  and  do  not  require  cooking.  The  species  has  tiny,  
     non-viable  seeds. Propagation is only vegetative, by  suckers,  and  movement  is only by man. Plant  are  
     variable in phenotype, being genetically very motile. Syn. j aina. See tiaina for more details.

     (formerly  G.  j asminoides),  introduced  from  the  Orient.  There  are  eight  other  Gardenia    species,  
     including G. vitiensis as named by Seemann.

            Some words may begin with either k or q  such  as  kasivi, qasivi, depending on regional dialect. The k  
tends  to be used by  "true"  Fijians  of  Viti  Levu,  while  the  q  is  more  common  among  the  island people  of  
Lau, Kadavu or Vanualevu-icake or Vanualevu-ira, where there is a substantial Tongan influence.  
          For  many  of  the  dialects  of  Cakaudrove  and  Macuata  the  k  is  replaced by  a  glottal  stop,  as  in  la ’o  for  
lako  (go).   But  when  an  introduced  foreign  word has  a  k  sound,  the  k  sound  is usually retained.   In  Bua,  
the k is often replaced by an h.  The fruit (Morinda citrifolia) kura becomes hura. In parts of Vanua Levu,  
k may be omitted at the beginning of  a word.  In Fiji  as well as many other Pacific languages, it is vowels  
rather than consonants that serve to anchor the meaning of words.

     kavica  ? raises the question  as to which ranking.    kadua usually means  "other "  as is na yasana kadua   
     the other side.    taura na kadua     take the other one. na ikarua   the second (after the first),  but karua   
     refers to a certain family relative of same sex.

     in  schoolroom geometry.  noca  north.  sauca   south.   isi or  isiti  east.  wesi   (or) wesiti  (or)  ra   west.

     Pacific  ocean,  with  the  doldrums  in between .   noca  isi    northeast.    noca  wesi   northwest.  And  so  on.

     discovered by T. M . Raynor, Medical Officer of the H .M.S. Herald, in October,  1855. He named it for  
    the  ship ’s naturalist. For many decades it was not  again  sighted. Conservationist Dr. Dick Watling has  
    recently rediscovered the bird,  always  alone,  separate from its mate. The bird is  strictly monogamous,  
     and even after the death of the mate, will remain alone for up to five years. The nest is thought to be a  
    burrow but has never been found. Watling  and Fiji ’s National Trust are looking to overseas  aid to help  
    learn  about  the  nesting  habits,  probably  with  the  help  of  New  Zealand’s  sniffing  dogs.  All  this  is

     son  called  Manasa  may be  addressed  as  Tama  i  Manasa,  and referred  to  as  such.  Similarly,  formerly,

     thoroughly,  grated  finely  and  washed  in  several  changes  of  running  water.  This  makes  a bland  starch  
     food with the texture of very soft mashed potato. Fij ians may  add strip s of the boiled  seeds icibi, from  
     the vine walai, Entada phaseoloides, which adds  a nutty taste.  Some highlanders kaiColo of Colo East  
     refer  to  this  as  revereve,  with  first  fruits  isevu  offered  to  the  chief  around  April.  Traditionally  eastern

     cultivated,  Acalypha  insulana,  Euphorbiaceae,  red  flowers  in  a  cat-tail,  large  round  leaves.    This  is  a  
     totem  at Nalawa in Ra, symbolic of their human genitals; the name of the plant is not to be pronounced  
     in  that  area.  The  leaves  are  an  ingredient boiled  with  Pandanus  leaves  (after  soaking  the  Pandanus  in  
     the  mud)  to  fix  the black  colour, used  along  with  the  leaves  of  koka  tree,  Bischofia j avanica,  notably

kalavo 1.  (Eng.)  social club, night club.  
kalavo  2.    rat,  mouse.  Fij ians  words  did  not  distinguish  clearly  between  rats  and  mice,  which  they  
     considered to be  small rats. Mice were inadvertently introduced  and  are now  sometimes  called mausi.   
     The  Polynesian  rat  (Rattus  exulans)  was  very  likely  an  aboriginal  introduction,  and  rats  were  caught  
     and eaten in former times, before European  sensibilities inhibited the custom.  Now the Polynesian rat  
     is restricted mainly to smaller, offshore islands because it cannot compete with two later introductions,  
     the black rat  (R . rattus)  of  the  forests,  and  the  Norway rat  (R.  norvegicus),  which usually  depends  on  
     humans  and  lives  close  to  them,  and  close  to  water,  for  it  is  an  agile  swimmer.  Of  Asian  origin,  the  
     Norway  rat  is  also  responsible  for  carrying  the  flea  that  is  the  vector  for  bubonic  plague,  which  has  
     never been know to occur in Fiji. Surprisingly, there are some fifteen cases a year in the U .S.A.  
       The black rat has  a long tail  (longer then the head  and body),  and is  an  agile climber of trees,  capable  
     of leaping  among the tree-tops. The female black rat has ten nipples, while the Polynesian rat has only  
     eight, and the Norway rat has twelve.  A  short tail distinguishes the Norway rat  as it is far  shorter than  
     the head  and body.   The  Polynesian rat-tail  is  about  the  same  length  as  its head  and body.   All  of  the  
     rats  have  caused  serious  depradation  of  birds  that  nest  on  the  ground,  including  the  aboriginally  
     introduced jungle fowl. (I  am indebted to Paddy Ryan for most of these notes.)  
kalavo 3. n. (Slang)  prostitute.   
kalawa,  kalawaca    v.    to  step,  step  over.    kalawaca  na  ikelikeli      step  over  the  ditch.    E  kalawa  ga  
     vakavica .   He  took just  a  few  step s.  Syn.  lakawa.  By  ext.  kalawaca   to  omit,  to  skip,  or  to pass  over,  
     improperly but perhaps inadvertantly, some item or some person(s).   
ikalawa  n. step, as in walking, used sometimes as a crude measure of length.  
kalesi   broken, hanging down (branch of tree).  
Kalevu or Kwalevu n. chiefly title  at the coast of Nadroga. With some degree of presumption, this title is  
     now considered by the national administration to be paramount in Nadroga Province.   
kali    n.  (Archaic)  neck-rest,  traditional  artefact  of  carved  wood  or  bamboo,  to  support  the  head  while  
     sleeping. It  also protected  a man ’s coiffure,  an important feature of vanity.  Now carved  and  sold only

     as  tourist  souvenir.  Though  no  longer  used,  the  neck-rest  is  comfortable  to  one  accustomed  to  it.

     also  when  husband  and  wife  may  resume  sexual  intercourse.    This  delay  of  time  between  births  of  
     children is traditional, preceding Christianity.   
kali-na    n.    of  banana  or  plantain,  the  lower  hands  on  the  bunch,  thought  to  be  of  less  good  quality  and  
     size compared to the upper hands of the fruit. See veta-i-cake.  
kalia    1.  n.  edible  double-headed  parrot  fish,  greyish  light  brown  in  colour,  large  scales,  Bolbometopon  
     muricatus, nibbles at the coral, schools at night.   
kalia  2. n  (Archaic,  Syn. drua, now the more common name).  A huge obsolete type of  sea-going canoe  
     developed  mainly  by  Tongans  in  Fiji  in  the  last  quarter  of  the  1700s.    The  ship  had  great  carrying  
     capacity  and  could  beat  to  windward.    It  was  a  major  factor  in  the  conquest  and  trade  that  brought  
     Tongan  influence  to  dominate  and  integrate  in  Fij i.    The  timber  was  Fij ian  vesi  (Instia bijuga)  which  
     was still  abundant  at Kabara  and in parts of Cakaudrove. With its outrigger, the kalia hull was partly  a  
    proto-Polynesian  concept.  The  bow-shape,  mast  and  sail-plan  owe  more  to  Micronesian  technique,  
     with stern and bow interchangeable to facilitate tacking.  Two famous Samoan builders in Fij i, Lemaki  
     and  Leha  of  Manono  Island,  are  credited  with  adapting  features  of  the  Samoan  fishermen's  paddling  
     canoe,  the  va 'a  alo.  They  added  planking,  with  a  simple  cutwater  bow  and  an  uplifted,  tapered  stern  
     that  were  functionally  interchangeable  when  the   ship  was  tacking.    Famous  kalia  include  the  
     "Draunivia"  of  Tanoa,  105  feet,  built  1820  by  Maopo  of  Kabara.  This  topic  owes  much  to  Fergus  
     Clunie.    
kaliko  n. (Eng.)  calico, but in Fiji, the term covers several sorts of cotton fabric.  
ikalima  fifth (in sequence). lima  five.  lima is a Proto-Polynesian word for “hand”.

     stunned.   matakalokalo   n.  constellation  of  stars.  Only  Polynesian  navigators had  a knowledge  of  the

     declination  (celestial  latitude)  and  knew  what  islands  were  to  be  found  under  which  major  star’s  
     declination. The star Sirius, for example, signals the latitude of Fij ian islands.

Kalou   n.  God,  a  word  adapted by  Methodist  missionaries  for  their  Christian  God  and  then used  also by  
     Roman  Catholics  and  later  denominations.  Earlier,  kalou  meant  “ghost”  or    “spirit”,  in  some  cases  
     tribal gods who might be protective, as in kalou vu.  These days one tends to refer to spirits as tevoro, a  
     word of Tongan origin, meaning  devils,  a concept that did not previously exist in Fiji.  Devils are very  
    real  to  many  Fijians.   The  ancient  Fijian  kalou  might be powerful  and  sometimes  dangerous but  they  
     were not perforce evil and they were certainly not satanic.

    Mo kalougata tiko! Be happy !  See Degei, legendary immigrant chief, later a sacred spirit.  
kalou-gata 2.  n.  good fortune, happiness, blessings.

     are  married  to  a  couple  of  sisters.  Two  such  related  people  are  said  to  be  veikaruani.    Karua  can  be  
    used  as  a  form  of  address,  now  sometimes  used  jokingly  amongst  unrelated  people  if  the  potential  
    partner is found to be attractive.

    the  flooring, Pteridium esculentum.   Syn.  koukou, qato.  These names may be used  for more  than one  
     species. One such is Dicranopteris linearis.

    dried as an adulterant to the beverage when it is sold in the form of powder. Virtually all yaqona that is  
     sold  as  powder  is  adulterated  with  kasa  or  the  rhizome  (lewena)  that  has  a  weaker  flavour  (lower  
    kavalactone content) than the root (waka). That is why Fijians often prefer to buy unpounded kava, and  
    do the pounding themselves.

    has white throat  and breast).  Rarely go out to  sea more  than 75 miles  and thus  an  indicator of nearby  
    land.    Cannot  land  at  sea  because  feathers  are  not  water-repellant  and  feet  not  webbed.  With  long  
    hooked  bill  it  often  steals  small  fish  caught  by  other  birds.  In  breeding  season  males  can  display  
    conspicuous red throat-patch .  Syn. (Regional) lasaqa.

kata  1.    (Eng.)  n.    cutter  (boat),  which  replaced  Fijian  canoes.  Cutters  were  much  used  for  Fij ian  inter- 
     island  sailing  from  the  1920s  or  earlier,  through  the  1950s,  before  the  use  of  outboards  engines,  
     motorized boats  and scheduled airlines. Fijians  are a very motile people  and this was an historic era of  
     intrepid  sailing. Ports like Levuka  and Lautoka were  sometimes crowded with cutters. The cutters had  
     no radio  or  navigational  equipment,  though  some had  motors.  Only  the  larger  cutters had  a  compass.  
     Often  the  boats  were  overloaded  with  people  and  cargo,  and  hardly  ever  had  life  preservers  or  extra  
     water.  Living  conditions  aboard  had  no  amenities.  This  word    has  fallen  into  disuse  since  cutters  are  
     obsolete.  The port of Levuka lost its importance in sea traffic when motorised boats became common.   
     In  Macuata  and  some  other parts  of  Vanua  Levu,  the  word  kata  was  also  applied  to  motorised boats,  
     Joe Hewson tells me. Syn. waqa vakalaca, the general term for sailboats.

ikatalau  n. breakfast food, these days a rather formal word.  More modernly, familiarly, one  says gunu ti,

     things of practical everyday use (bowl, knives).  Cuts are made rapidly so that quite a bit of money can  
     be  made,  and  almost  everybody  goes  home  with  some  prizes.  This  is  a  good  feeling  of  social

katuba    n.  doorway  but  modernly  that  implies  a  door.  Fijian  did  not  have  a  fixed  or  hinged  door.  They  
    used  unattached  matting  or  woven  leaves  as  a  closure  (isogo).  In  the  highland  a  block  of  wood  was  
     sometimes used that was propped up by a stone that covered up half of the doorway. (See Roth, F ij ian  
     Way  of   Lif e,  p .  26.)  The  height  of  the  doorway  opening  was  formerly  very  low ;  a  visitor  could  not  
    enter  erect. This would delay  an  attacker.  Syn. darava.   icurucuru  entrance/exit.  Early Fij ian houses  
    had  only  one  doorway,  usually  on  the  lee  side,  and  no  windows.  Later  Colonial  authorities  required  
    houses to have at least two doors and three windows.   
katuba leka  (Anglicism) n. window. Traditional Fijian houses had no windows. leka  short.

kau  n., adj .  plant (small herbaceous plant, shrub, bush, or tree), timber, wood, stick.  vu ni kau  tree.  vale  
    kau    wooden  house.    A  clan ’s  “plant”  (kau  or  kautabu)  is  its  sacred  plant  totem,  a  feature  of  
    Melanesian Fij ians,  especially on Viti Levu.  Prohibitions have  surrounded  such totems  and usually,  a  
    highland Fijian (kaiColo) will not mention the word and cannot discuss the  subject when it has fertility  
     and  reproductive  implications.    In  some  places  a  certain  plant  may  be  iconic,  though  not  a  fertility  
    totem.  (The  Native  Lands  Commission  confuses  the  two  concepts  and  has  erred  in  believing  that  all  
    Fijian  clans  have  totems).    kau-vuata    fruit-tree.    kau-salusalu    tree  that  yield  attractive  or  sweet-

kau na mata ni gone  n.  a ceremony of introducing children to their mother’s village, bringing substantial  
    gifts  (kerosene,  mats, bales  of  cloth).    By  this,  children  are  formally recognized  at  the  village.   (This  
    ceremony  is  based  on  the  traditional  notion  that  the  mother  lives  away  from  her  own  village,  having  
    joined her husband’s  village  at  marriage;  these  days  that  is  not  so  often  the  case.)  Fijian  children  are  
    not  supposed  to  appear  at  their  mother’s  village  till  this  ceremony has been performed.   After  it,  they  
    will have the rights  and duties of  a vasu.  These days parents often wait to take  all their children at the  
     same time, so some of their children may already be in their teens.  Commoners now sometimes ignore

    other  indigenous  species  with  a  small  nut,  hard  to  crack,  eaten  only  as  an  occasional  snack.    In  
    Vanuatu,  and  especially  parts  of  the  Solomons  and  Papua-New  Guinea  there  are  more  cultivars  and  
    this  nut  (larger  than  the  Fijian  species)  was  formerly  a  major  staple  food  before  the  introduction  of  
     sweet potato  and cassava that have displaced it completely .  In western Melanesia, the Canarium nut is  
    often  know  as  the  galip  nut.  Colourless  sap  turns  white  on  exposure.  See  yagai,  a  Lauan  name  that  
    derives  from  a  Solomon  language.  Syn.  kaunigai,  referring  possibly  to  the  fact  that  wild  pigs  
     sometimes  eat  the  bark .  (gai    baby  pig).    The  name  kaunicina  may  also  apply  to  Haplolobus  
    floribundus; hardened flammage latex formerly used in torches.   
kaudamu  n. timber tree,  Myristica  castaneifolia,  syn. maile in eastern Fiji, closely related to commercial

     insect.  Among some Fij ian groups, especially Viti Levu highlanders, it is forbidden to mention names

kerekere  2.  n.,  v .    custom  of  making  demands  on  relatives,  friends,  employers,  that  are  difficult  or  
     impossible  for  a Fijian to refuse.  Reciprocity occured usually later, perhap s quite indirectly to  a close  
     relative,  a  favour done,  some food given,  schoolbooks bought,  some help with garden labour. It might  
     be   considered   vulgar   to   pay   back   too   directly   too   soon.   The   system   was   based   on   mutual  
     supportiveness  that  is  still  quite  functional  in  segments  of  Fijians  society.  But  the  social  system  has  
     been  changing,  with  some  abuses  occuring.  Nonetheless,  a  person  might  be  resented  if  he  bluntly  
     declines  a request  and  as  a  result,  Fijians usually have  trouble  saying  “no”.    It  could be  thought rude  
     and unkind.  Thus  it  is  difficult  for  a  Fijian  to  accumulate  much  wealth  while  living  as  a  Fij ian  in  the  
     Fijian  context.  Kinship  relations  are  extremely  important  to  the  Fijian,  not  individual  advancement,  
     and  certainly  not  individual  accumulation  of  wealth.    kerekere  bibi    urgent  or  pressing  request.    See  
     dole, dolea  for the return exchange in response to kerekere  and for general reciprocity.

kere    v.  to  boil,  bubble  actively  (liquid),  purr  (cat),  wheeze  (sleeper,  person  with  cold),  reinforced  by  
     redup. kerekere.   vakerea  na wai  to boil the water.   
      Idiom:   tabu  rogoca  na  kere  ni  cakau   said  to  one  who  does  not  listen  to  instructions  or  good  advice.  
     Lit. does not listen to the sound of the sea against the reef.  
ikeri    there,  in  the  place  where  you  are  (the  person  being  talked  to),  kere  preceded  by  “i”  or  “e”,  which  
     may not be heard in certain situations  
keria    (Eng.)  n.  carrier,  van,  truck.  This  relatively  modern,  general  term  has  virtually  replaced  the  older  
     term  lori    (Eng.)  lorry.    The  change  occured  with  the  popularity  of  vehicles  rented  (with  driver),  to  
     transport  goods  for  Fijians  going  to  and  from  their  villages.    Road  access  to  villages  has  increased  
     greatly in recent years and there is a strong demand for rented “carriers”.

koli    n.  dog.  The  term  does  not  derive  from  English  "collie ".    Polynesians  raised  dogs,  fed  them  a

     Balavu,  and  Gau  Island.  Killing  was  by  strangulation.  But  the  dog  is  sacred  in  quite  a  number  of  
     places,  as  with  the  clan  Nanuku-ira  of  the  DauLakeba  tribe,  who  have  a  black  dog  as  their  founding  
     spirit.  A  dog  is  the  iconic  animal  of  a  fair  number  of  tribes.    Fij i  Melanesians  have  no  tradition  of  
     keeping  dogs  for  eating  but  highlanders  would  eat  almost  any  living  thing  they  could  catch  and  that  
     includes  feral  dogs  and  cats,  introduced  by  Europeans.  Dogs  are  often  kept  to  help  them  in  hunting  
     pigs.  Fijians have  almost  never kept  dogs  (or  cats)  as  close  members  of  the  family,  as  the  British  do.   
     Caution:    in  Macuata,  koli  can  refer  to  fish.  Feral  or  domestic  dogs  in  Fij i  are  sometimes  subject  to  
     mange  caused  by  the  scabies  mite,  Sarcoptes  scabiei,  which  can  be  treated  with  pyrethrin,  or  its  
     synthetic equivalent, permethrin .  Heartworm is also a problem for dogs.

     family  house  which  has  become  the  custom.    While  sue  can  mean  “house”  in  the  West,  it  more

     prior  indication  of  dissatisfaction.   Fij ians  may be  afraid  to  speak  openly  at  the  time  of  a   decision  or

kuita  1.  n. octopus,  a  cephalopod with eight  arms, each with two rows of  suckers. On males, one  arm  is  
    modified to implant sperm packets into the female. For feeding, there is a beak and a radula that serves  
     as  a  file to open crustaceae  and  shellfish . Movement is by walking or by  a type of jet-propelled thrust.  
    Black  “ink”  helps  conceal  its  exact  location  and  confuse  predators.  rubi,  rubica  na  kuita.    beat  the  
    octopus  (to  soften it).  The octopus  is usually  speared,  most bountifully beginning  around July  (Fijian  
    lunar  month  vula  i  cukicuki), plentiful  through  August.  Larger  ones,  to  five  feet  in  length,  are  turned  
    inside  out  to  kill  them,  expertly  done  by  Gilbertese  and  some  Fijians.  Such  kuita  can  be  very  
    dangerous  in  self-defense.    Small  octopi,  very  shy,  very  sensitive,  can  be  tamed  and  become  quite  
    friendly though always  shy and quickly reactive.  (I have kept  some as pets in  a  sea garden  at Katafaga  
    Island.  I love them too much  ever to hurt them or  eat  them.) Octopi  are reputed  to be very intelligent.  
    They  are powerless  out  of  water.    Besides  eating  octopus,  Fijians  like  to use  it  as  a preferred bait  on  
    fishing  lines.    Many  Fijians  have  the  curious  notion  that  cats  or  dogs  would  lose  their  coat  of  hair  if  
    they eat octopus. They also believe that to kill a an undesired tree (such as an African Tulip that is hard  
    to  eradicate),  one has  only  to plant  the beak  of  an  octopus  at  its base.  Syn.  (Serua, parts  of  the West)  
    sulua (or) hulua.   
kuita 2.  n.   as  in baca  kuita   an idiom, meaning  a  special enticement  in human  affairs, based on  the fact  
    that octopus kuita  is a preferred, effective bait (baca) on a fishing line.     
kuita 3. n. octopus, but by extension, a very painful headache, migraine. Syn. kuitamona, kuitaquruquru.  
kuita 4.  n,  asterisk, a Fij ian word invented by teachers of Fijian language. Syn. kalokalo.  s  
kuita-ni-nubu  n. Nautilus pompilius, formerly caught in deep waters outside reefs. Occasionally  seen  at  
    the surface, the shells sometimes found on beaches.  
kuita-nu    n.  Bigfin  Reef  Squid,  Sepiatenthis  lessonicena,  calamari,  a  cephalopod.  When  small,  squid  
    move in  schools,  sometimes  almost immobile, but capable of darting very quickly. Fij ians hardly  ever  
    caught them which would seem to require specialised nets, fast reaction time, and a lot of luck.  Unlike  
    octopi,  two  of  the  ten  arms  are  adapted  for  swimming.  They  each  have  four  rows  of  suckers.  Squid  
    tend  to  swim  about  while  octopi  tend  to  clamber  about.  Large  squid  exist  only  in  deep  water,  never  
    encountered  by  humans.  The  very  large  ones  are  food  for  the  sperm  whale  which  can  dive  to  great  
    depths. Syn. (West) sulua qalo.   
kuka   n.  type  of  small  crab,  dark  coloured  with  a  little red,  living  among  mangroves,  often used  for bait,  
    best beginning  around  January.  Sesarma  spp.    Idiom :    Sa  ua  levu,  sa  kaba  na  kuka .   Times  are  good  
     and we are prospering. Lit.  High tide is rising and the kuka crab s are coming out.    
kuku    n.  mussel,  Modiolus  spp.,  edible.  The  sharp  edge  of  the  shell  kai  kuku  used  for  smoothing  and  
    cleaning pandanus leaf preparatory to weaving, and formerly used for cutting small things.   Name of  a  
    people and village near Suva. Syn. (West)  boro.   
kukuna    v.  as  is  kukuni  koya    to  hang  oneself.  In  earlier  times  this  was  virtually  unknown  in  Fiji.  It  is  
    much more common among Fiji Indians than among Fij ians. See kuna.   
kukuva  v.  to grasp, usually another person ’s hand or some support such  as  a rope or the branch of  a tree,  
    to prevent a fall, or to prevent slipping into deep water, or a drowning.   
kukuvu  adj . worm-eaten, as of fruit.    
kukuwalu    n.  cultivated  plant  introduced  by  Tongans  and  particularly  associated  with  Bau  island.  The  
    plant  is  famous  in  Fiji  for  its  fragrant  flowers  praised  in  a  popular  sentimental  song.    Extremely  few  
    Fijians have  ever  seen  or  smelled  the plant.  It  does  not  grow  wild  and  is rarely  cultivated.   One plant  
    has  been  grown  by  Asena  Liga  at  Toorak,  and  took  seven  years  to  flower.  The  plant  somewhat  
    resembles  a  pandanus  shrub,  with  long  sharp  leaves  with  tiny  thorns  at  the  edge.  Flowers  are  in  a  
    whitish  sprig  that becomes  fragrant  at  dusk.  The plant used  to  grow  famously  at  Lasakau  on  Bau but  
    there is none there today . The Lasakau were naval warriors with early Tongan affiliations. The Tongan  
    woven cummerbund (tauf ala in Fij ian) was often traditionally made of the leaves of kukuwalu, and the  
    flowers  used  for  chiefly  Tongan  salusalu.  Commonly  used  today  as  Lauan  tauf ala  is  the  more  
     accessible voivoi  pandanus.  John Parham does not list  kukuwalu in his Plants of   the F ij i Islands,  and  
    nor does A. C.  Smith in Flora Nova  Vitiensis. In Tonga the plant  is known  as  kukuvalu  and in  Samoa  
     as uuwalu.    
kula   (Polyn.)  1.   endemic  small bird  with bright red  feathers,  the  Collared  Lory,  Phygis  solitarius,  feeds  
    on nectar  and pollen,  favouring drala Erythrina  sp., notably in August,  September, moving quickly in  
    groups,  also  favouring  the  flowering  vuga  trees.  Tongans  came  to  Fiji  to  barter  for  the  red  feathers,  
    highly  prized  especially  by  Samoan  chiefs.  Tongans  traded  them  to  Samoa,   a  very  significant  
    commerce that existed long before the  arrival of Europeans. The more  ancient, indigenous Fijian name  
    for this bird is drisi or drusi according to Geraghty.

kula    (Polyn.)  2.    highly  coloured  (red,  blue)  wool  edging  on  the  borders  of  some  mats,  a  modern,  less  
    costly version of  early Tongan  mats  that used red parrot  feathers  as  an edging.  e dua na  ibe  vakula   a

    expression. Syn. kolo.  
kulu  (West) n.  breadfruit, totemic is some parts of the west and thus a word that is best not pronounced at  
    Viseisei, for example.

    leaves that have  a winged petiole, Dillenia biflora, Dilleniaceae. Used  as  a living fence.  Once  cut, the  
    young  stems  and  branches  rot  quickly  because  the  centre  is  of  soft  wood;  to  endure  they  must  be  
    planted. They will  then  sprout promptly,  sometimes becoming  a nuisance, difficult  to  eradicate.  Slash  
    is  red  with red  sap  and pinkish brown  wood.  In  Tailevu  Province,  kuluva  is  totemic  for  tribe  Daviko  
     and  tribe  Vugalei.    An  earlier  location  of  village  Nayavu  was  called  Navunikuluva  (“The  Kuluva

kuluvotu  n. bird, Many-Coloured Fruit Dove, Ptilinopus perousii, favours fruiting banyan trees, common  
    in forests.   
kumala   (Polyn.)  n.  sweet potato.   This  word  and  the plant have  their  origins  in  South  America, proving

    female  attendants  to  be  buried  with  a  dead  paramount  chief,  especially  at  Bau  and  Cakaudrove.   
    Elderly  people  were  often  strangled  when  they  became  infirm.    Fijians  believed  they  were  already  
    effectively  dead  very  soon  after  becoming  incapacitated.    dau  veikuna    n.  hangman.  The  concept  of  
    hanging  is  not  Fij ian  but  was  used  as  early  as  1859  on  Bau  by  Cakobau  when  he  betrayed  Mara  
    Kapawai  after  assuring his  immunity  from  any revenge  for rebellion.   Hanging  as  a  legal punishment

kura  n.  small  coastal  tree,  Morinda  citrifola,  Rubiaceae,  edible  but  bitter  fruit  is  a  knobby  oval,  eaten  
     ceremonially  as  an  act of cleansing by grave  tenders  after  the burial of  a Bauan Vunivalu. The fruit is  
    passed  from  one  man  to  another, passed behind  their backs,  for  each  man  to  take  a bite.   (They  then  
    jump  into  the  sea  to  bathe,  all  part  of  the  cleansing  ceremony.)  When  ripe  the  fruit  is  white  with  
     curious, distinctive taste liked by only  a few people. It is normally eaten by virtually nobody. The root  
    produces  a  yellow  dye,  reddish  when  mixed  with  lime.  The  bark  makes  a  red  dye.  P.  Geraghty  
     suggests  that  the  name  derives  from  kula,  proto-Polynesian  version  of  kurati  (“turmeric”,  and  much  
    later,  “metallic  gold”)  in  the  Moluccas).    Called  hura  in  parts  of  Vanua  Levu.    The  old,  ripe  fruits  
    become quite  smelly as they rot. In the marketing of commercial herbal medicine this fruit is promoted  
     as  useful  in  the  treatment  of  cancer  and  other  ailments.  The  fruit  is  antiseptic  but  other  medical  
    properties are unproven.  Polynesian names are variants of noni.

ikurau  n.  exclamation, a modern word invented by language teachers.   
kure, kurea, kuretaka  v. to  shake.   kure,  kurea may refer  to  shaking of branches to bring down fruit, or  
     shaking  a  small  tree  to  cause  a  fruit-bat  to  fall  and be  caught.  Syn .  ure,  urea .      kurekure    to  shake,  
     usually the head, implying  a  negative response. Nodding  an  affirmative response would be done by  a  
     slight raising of the chin  or eyebrows (deguvacu).   sautakurekure  v. to vibrate.  See sakure.    
kurei,  kurei-taka    v.  to  sprinkle  some  liquid,  fine  powder  (flour,  pepper),  or  sand.  May  have  the  
     implication of shaking it, even shaking it off the hands.

     qai  kuri  tale  yani.    To  be  continued  (as  an  ending  of  one  part  in  a  series  of  stories  or  articles  
    published.)  na   ikuriliu  n. the prefix to  a root-word,  as in  laukana, the prefix  lau  attached  as  a prefix  
    to  the  root-word  kana.    ikuri-i-muri  n.  suffix,  as  with  taka  in  the  transitive  verb  kure-taka.    These  
     grammatical  terms  are  of  course  invented  modernisms.  Some  school-teachers  think  it  necessary  to  
     create Fijian words for these concepts.   
vakuria  v. to continue.  vakuria na noqu  ilakolako.  continue on my trip.  
kuro    n.  cooking  pot,  trad.  only  in  clay,  made  only  in  a  few  coastal  villages  of  Fij i,  mainly  by  Tongan  
     immigrants  and  their  descendants  in  Nadroga  Province  (villages  Nakabuta,  Lewai),  Rewa  Province  
     (Nasilai),  Kadavu  (Yawe),  and  in  Ra  Province,  formerly  also  at  village  Levuka  on  Lakeba.   Firing  of  
    pots  is  done  in  outdoor  fires,  not kilns.   (Only  at  Noikoro,  Navosa  are pots  cured  in  the  sun,  without  
     fire).  While  pottery  for  cooking  and  water  storage  has  been  retained  in  Polynesian  areas  of  Fiji,  that  
    practice was abandoned in Samoa, and was never a significant feature of Tonga.  It is curious then, that  
    pot-making  in  Fij i began  only  as  an  influence  from  Tongan  immigrants.  Large pots  for  storing  water  
     were known  as  saqa.   Two basic  types  of  cooking pot  are  the  large,  tall  one  for  steaming  food  and  a  
     smaller,  wide  short,  virtually round pot  (ivakariri)  for boiling  fish.   The base  for  all pots  was  always  
    round, never flat,  so props  (isue) of clay or  stones  could keep  the pot  a  sloping  angle during  cooking.  
    The pot opening was plugged with  a lid improvised from leaves.  Pots were traded up into the interior  
    highlands where  they were very rare.  They were  imported there, usually in  exchange  for yaqona that  
    thrives  in  many  inland  places.  Curiously ,  pottery  was  never  one  of  the  goods  used  in  traditional  
     exchanges known  as  solevu  which  involved  ceremonial  and  social  interaction  as  well  as  exchange  of  
     goods. Highlanders used bamboo tubes for water storage and as cooking pots, and they grilled much of  
    their  food  without  the  use  of  clay  pots.  The  only  highlanders  who  made  clay  pots  were  in  Navosa  
     where  Tongans  penetrated  in  the  1700s,  introducing  the  making  of  pots  and  also  of  barkcloth  (masi)  
     from the mulberry tree.

           In Kadavu,  southwest  and southeast Viti Levu,  and also  among the Levuka people in Lau, clay was  
    formed in  slabs, beaten together with  a paddle.  In Ra  and LomaiViti,  coils or rings were used. On the  
    Vanua  Levu  coast,  and  at  Yanuya  in  Mamanuca,  there  was  a  basal  slab  to  which  rings  were  added.  
    After  sun-drying, pots  are fired on open ground with burning grass or bamboo, never fired in  any  sort  
    of  kiln.    In  a  few  places  fire-pits  are  used.  Cooking  pots  were  never  glazed  and  rarely  had  any  
    decoration  at  all.  When used  for  water pots,  glaze has been  made  of  resin  makadre,  from  the  dakua  
    tree,  though  for  tourist,  store-bought  varnish  in  now  more  common.  Many  of  the  clay  pots  made  for  
    tourists  now  are  insufficiently  fired  to be  strong  enough  to  contain  water.   Some  water pots  were  not  
    glazed,  to  allow  evaporation  that  kept  the  water  cool.    The  only  fanciful  pots  have  been  small  water  
    pots  for  direct  drinking.  They  had  one  or  more  spouts,  the  water  being  poured  into  the  mouth  from  
     several  inches  away.  Cups  were  never  used  except  until  later,  when  folded  leaves  and  then  half  
    coconut  shells  were  adopted  for  drinking  yaqona.  Coconut  shell  cups  came  with  the  serving  bowl  
     (tanoa)  that  Tongans  introduced  with  the  Samoan  custom  of  drinking  kava  in  hierarchical  groups,  
    ceremoniously  in  an  ordered  circle,  in  the  latter part  of  the  1700s.  The  adopted  word  for  “cup”  (bilo)  
    comes from the word for the similarly shaped knee-cap. Previously, Fijians had no cups.   
           Sherd are still found of pre-Fijian pots dating to  1600 B.C., known as Lapita pottery, named for the  
    place  in  New  Caledonia  where  these  type  of  pots  were  first  found.    Lapita  pots  often  had  simple  
    markings as decoration.  These were made by a  seafaring people who settled only by the shore, e.g. Ba  
     (at  Natunuku)  and  Sigatoka,  Nananu-i-ra  Island.    They  are  believed  to  be  proto  central  Polynesians.   
    By  about  500  A.D. pottery  was  no  longer  made  in  Samoa  or  Tonga  for reasons  that  are unexplained.  
    Tongan pottery  did  continue  in  Fiji  in  a  few  isolated places,  though  it  is  now  made  only  for  tourists.   
    The  notion  of  minature  pots  for  tourists  originated  with  the  author  of  this  dictionary  who  made  the  
    very first ones  at Wainadoi,  Namosi  for domestically grown  spices to be  sold in gift  shops.  kuro ni  ti

     the  root-bark  of  the  trees  kura  (Morinda  citrifolia),  and gadoa  (Macaranga  sp.,  Euphorbiaceae).   The  
     latter has  a red  sap.  Curiously,  some of the Vatulele people use indiscriminately the terms masi kuvui   
     and  masi  toni,  which  is  more  usually  used  for  the  rich  brown  that  results  from  being  soaked  in  an  
     infusion of the bark of the mangrove tree (dogo).  Both are soaked (toni) in vegetable dye.

ilakovi  n. ceremony to recognise the transfer of persons to identify themselves officially with  another  so- 
     cial  group.  Children  may  thus  often become  identified  with  their  mother's  clan  (mataqali) rather  than  
     the father's. A Fijian “belongs” to one village  and to one clan within that village. A person is  supposed  
     to be “written down” to  a  clan in the official registry  iVola ni Kawa Bula.   (The N.L.C. has estimated  
     for me that  about one tenth of  all Fij ians remain unregistered.) This  system of  transfer may be used to  
     supply  a  chieftain  where  none  was born  to  that  role.  This  was  the  case  with  Ratu  Josefa  Iloilo, being  
     re-registered  at  village  Viseisei  late  in  life  to become  Tui  Vuda,  when  village  Viseisei  need  a  chiefly  
     candidate, long after his initial registration to his mother ’s people on Taveuni.   
lala    adj .  empty  (container),  depopulated  (village),  unoccupied  (chiefly  title).  lala  didi    adj .    completely  
     empty of people, of a place, such as an old village, or a school-house during holidays.    
      Idiom: ulu lala  ignorant, empty-headed.  
      Idiom:  Sa  lala  tu na koro.  lit.,  the village is  empty of people, but in the case of  a chiefly village may  
     mean the chief is  absent or that there is no chief.  Quite  a few  titles  are vacant due to internal disputes  
     or complexities and delays in selecting  a chief.  In Rewa, chiefly village Lomanikoro was often said to  
     be “empty” because the late chiefly Roko Tui Dreketi rarely visited the village.   
      Idiom:  vaka-tu-lala  to stay alone, when others have gone.   
vakalala  v.  to vacate, leave empty  (house, parliamentary seat etc.)    
vakalala  sitoa  (Anglicism)   n.  store  clearance  (sale).   na  lutu  sobu  ni  vakalala  sitoa   the  store-clearance  
     sale.  A person going shopping, spending a lot of money, may be teased as if clearing out the store.    
lala   (Archaic) n. obligatory labour, usually farm labour, traditionally provided to  a chief by the common- 
     ers, but might include other community labour  such  as house-building, road-building. The earlier right  
     of chieftains to impose this duty was officially  abolished by the  colonial  administration due to  abuses  
     by the chieftains who used it only to their own advantage. Abolition of such chiefly rights made  a seri- 
     ous  problem  for  those  chiefs  who  had  no  salary  from  a  government  position  or  from  income  from  
     leased  land.  Only  the  salaried provincial  admininistrators  (Roko  Tui),  and under  them  the  Fijian  Dis- 
     trict Officers (Buli), were allowed to impose lala.

     1800s.    Around  Vanua  Levu  Island,  Laucala  was  ultimately  over-shadowed  by  Verata  and  by  super-

lauci  n. candlenut tree, Aleurites moluccana, Euphorbiaceae, very likely  an early  aboriginal  introduction,  
     established throughout the Pacific. The oily nuts are flammable, formerly used,  after drying, for lamps  
     by coastal Fij ians (not highlanders). Some 24 nuts were extracted from the shell, skewered, and placed  
     over  a bowl.  One  nut burned  at  a  time,  lasting  only  for  a  few  minutes,  with  ashes knocked  off  as  the  
     next nut is lit. Soot used for tattoo and black colouring for barkcloth. Nuts used modernly in Polynesia,  
     especially in Hawaii, for necklaces when the nut is polished to a shiny black but this was never done in  
     Fiji.   Roots  supplied  a  reddish  dye  for bark-cloth.  Bark  is  light  grey.  Slash  of  inner bark  is  white  sap  
     developing distinctive red  colour. Oil, with  coconut oil, used  as  skin lotion,  and  as  a base  for  fragrant  
     oil.  Common  around  the  coast,  especially  damp  places,  beside  rivers,  not  reaching  elevations  above  
     2,000  feet.  Can  grow  to  90  feet,  often  with  no  branches  in  the  lower  forty  feet  of  smooth  trunk,  but

     Leaves light green on top, powdery  silver below; young lves deeply  3-lobed. Flowers, cream coloured  
     (male  and female separate on the  same tree), and fruits  all year.  Nuts  are globose, fleshy drupes, 4 cm

lave, laveta  v. to raise, raise something up (not used for nets, fishing lines). lave liga  raise the hand (as in  
     school, or in voting by  a  show of hands).  It is  a modernism,  an Anglicism, to use the word for raising  
     the hand, though the  expression is now  in common use.   In traditional Fiji, raising  the hand would be  
     an impolite, possibly even a threatening gesture.

     fore  the  arrival  of  Fijians.   Similar  stories  of  a  short people  are heard  at  Nacula  Island  in  the  Yasawa  
     Group.  No  physical  remains  have  been  found.  Na  Leka  may  actually  have  been  real  people,  earlier  
     immigrants  who  were pygmy-size.    There  is  no  fantasy  associated  with  them.  They  are  distinct  from  
     the fabled gnomes or gremlins (na  iveli) who  are fantastic in their  abilities  and behaviour, though very  
     real to some Fij ians still today .  Na iveli are centred in Waimaro country around Serea. They have been  
     reportedly  clearly  sighted  by  Fijians  at  Wainadoi,  at  the  Namosi  coast.  Waimaro  people  from  the  
     Waidina  River  area  migrated  south  near  to  this  part  of  the  Namosi  coast.  The  early  existence  of  na  
     Leka  is  quite  plausible  though  they  have  never  been  seen.  Earliest  migrations  of  proto-island  people  
     came from southeast Asia, through what is now Indonesia, to settle in the Pacific. A tiny species of the  
     Homo genus, Homo floresiensis,  is well recorded  as  living  in Indonesia, from 74,000 to  12,000 years  
     ago, with  skeletons found  at Flores Island.  (See  article by Adam Brumm, Australian National Univer- 
     sity ,  et  al,  Nature,  June  1,  2006.)    This  species  of  man  was  half-size  to  present-day  humans,  Homo  
     sapiens. (See also Science News, vol. 269, 3 June, 2006, p. 34 1.)  
lekaleka   adj .  short, brief.   vaka-lekalekataka    to  shorten.   bati  leka,  a  formal  term  for  clans  of personal  
     guards  who  fought  as  a  last  defence,  protecting  the  chieftain.    At  Bau,  the  Masau  were  such  warrior  
     guardians for the Roko Tui Bau.  leleka is the plural  form. Only  a very few Fijian words take  a differ- 
     ent form in the plural.

     ers of Polynesian background  (Lau, Cakaudrove, Kadavu) remove  the  skin of  lewena before drying it.  
     This yields  a beverage lighter in  colour  and much less harsh. Highlanders never remove the  skin,  and  
     traditionally did not dry it, but drank it “green”, which has  a much stronger effect of the drug.  Rewans  
     of  Lomanikoro  drink  only  waka,  never  lewena;  their  soggy  land  makes  it  almost  impossible  to  grow  
     yaqona there.

liku  n.  skirt ; Formerly,  all  adults wore  a  skirt of  sorts, usually made of leaves. The loincloth  (malo), usu- 
     ally  of  bark-cloth  (masi),  was  an  early  innovation  from  Tonga,  used  mostly  by  chiefly  men,  and  by  
     warriors  as  a  war-time uniform,  especially  when  serving  as  mercenaries  for  Tongans.  Allies  wore  the  
     same malo to recognise  each other.  Highlanders of Colo East had crude indigenous loincloth made of  
     barkcloth  other  than  the  mulberry  masi,  which  hardly  existed  there  (only  at  Navosa,  introduced  by  
     early  Tongan  settlers).  The  liku  was  of  longer  length  for  men but  for  women  was  a  two  to  nine-inch  
     band  of  fibre  strings  covering  the  loins  when  she reached puberty .  Mature,  married  women  wore  the

     is  a  summary  of  comments  by  Seemann  writing  in  the  very  early  1860s:    Temporary  liku  might  be  
     made of leaves of plantain, coconut, or the climbing, vine vono (Alyxia spp., Apocynaceae), the  stems  
     partially  broken  to  release  the  natural  perfume.    Permanent  liku  were  often  made  of  sausauwai,  the  
     threads of a vine called waloa,  said by Seemann to be  a   species of Rhizomorpha, a creeper that grows  
     on  dead  wood  in  swampy  ground.  The revised  edition  of  Capell’s  dictionary  names  this  as  Armilaria  
     sp.,  Agaricaceae.  The  stems  are  thin  threads  buried  in  mud  for  few  days  before  being  made  into  a  
     black  skirt.  Women ’s  skirts were often made of the inner bark of hibiscus, left in natural white colour,  
     or  dyed.   Turmeric  gave  yellow,  mud  and  leaves  of  Polynesian  Almond  (tavola)  gave black  dye,  and  
     red was derived from the bark of bush or  small  tree kura Morinda  citrifolia,  and  the bark of  the  man- 
     grove  tree.    Except  in  the  case  of  very  high  chiefs  on  ceremonial  occasions,  Fij ians  normally  wore  
     nothing on the torso above the liku.   
lila  adj ., n.  thin.   
lila balavu   (Archaic) n. historic infectious disease that devastated the Fij ian population. Apparent  source  
     was the  schooner Argo, out of China,  shipwrecked  around  1800 at Bukatatanoa Reef eleven miles east  
     of Lakeba. Survivors  settled  at Oneata, with a few going to Tongatapu, some to Lakeba and beyond at  
     later times. Missionary John Hunt  suggested the cause was probably cholera or dysentery  according to  
     Derrick.   
lila waso  adj .  skinny (derogative, disparaging).   
lili,  liliga  (or) lilica  v . to  hang up,  suspend in the  air. Me  lili na  isulu.  Hang up the  laundry.  For retire- 
     ment from  a vocation, Fijians use the Anglicism of boxers “hanging up” their gloves, runners hanging  
     up their  shoes.  E a vakaliliga na nona  ivava. He/she has retired from track.  The transitive verb  liliva   
     is  used  for  hanging  people.  Anciently ,  Fijians  sometime  hung  up  corpses;  they  never  had  a  person  
     hang as punishment until Cakobau hanged his cousin Mara Kapaiwai in  1859.  wa-lili-caka na liga  to  
     swing the arms, as in soldiers marching.  
      Idiom:  (Vulgar) p olo  lili  (or)  vakalili  soresore      ineffectual  man  or  boy,  lit.  balls  (testicles)  drooping

ililili  1.  n.  (Archaic)  wooden  hook  for    hanging  oil  or  baskets  of  food  with  protective  ridge  as  a  guard  
     against rats. Some  are now carved for the tourist trade.  Naililili  is  a place in Rewa, location of  an im- 
     portant historic Roman Catholic church,  formerly  a place where  corpses were hung  up  (as  implied in  
     the name) prior to cannibal feasts.  
ililili 2. n.  clothes line or clothes hanger, which  are modern  artefacts. Previously, clothing of barkcloth or  
     leaves was laid out to dry in the sun.

     their children. See kutu.  
      Idiom:  M isika nona lise!   gross insult, implying a person is full of lice.

     that  are  trumpet-shaped  (thus  the  common  name  davui,  “trumpet”)  that  bloom  around  April  through  
     September,  and  become  fragrant  only  at  night.  Formerly  it  was  planted  near  the  house-sites  of  high- 
     land chiefs, and it may still be found by the ruined house-foundations at old villages  such  as Waikalou  
     (near  present-day  village  Serea).    The  plant  has  intoxicating  properties,  said  to  be  like  yaqona  but  
     vastly more potent, dangerously intoxicating  and even poisonous, but not usually  fatally  so  for  adults.  
     It was  formerly used by highlanders  as  a  secret drug  to  serve in yaqona presented to disable their  en- 
     emy while pretending to talk peace.  It  served to knock out the enemy so he could be clubbed to death  
     without resisting.  How  the plant reached  the  central  Pacific  is  a  mystery.  Its  origin  is  in  South  Amer- 
     ica.

     ince at Nausori.  The Roko Tui Bau moved on to Ovea  and Kubuna  at the coast, then invaded  and set- 
     tled  Bau  Island, possibly  around  1760.   The  Lobau people  at  Nausori  served  as  intermediaries  in  the  
     Roko Tui Bau ’s  communications with the Waimaro highlanders, by way of village  (and District) Ma- 
     tailobau,  and  chiefly  village  Nairukuruku.  This  traditional  path  of  communications  was  broken  after  
     the  Vunivalu  of  the  Tui  Kaba  people  of  Bau  overthrew  the  Roko  Tui  Bau.  While  the  highland  Wai- 
     maro had been warriors  and  allies of  the Roko Tui Bau , they long resisted the Vunivalu, whose com- 
     munications  to  the highlands  came  via  Sawakasa  in  Tailevu, by  way  of  the Waimaro-i-wai.   The  sig- 
     nificance of the lobau shrub is a rather forgotten aspect of Fij ians’ old traditions.   
          The  word  lobau  is  also  noted  widely  throughout  Fiji  as  the  adopted  name  of  an  introduced  plant

     glazing clay pots. No glaze was  applied to pots used for cooking or for  storage of drinking water. The  
     absence  of  glaze  allows  some  evaporation  that  keeps  the  water  cooler.    makadretaka    v.  to  apply  
     makadre glaze.  For the tourist trade, commercial varnish often replaces makadre as a glaze.  
makawa  1.  old  (referring to time or to things but not to people  ),  long  ago. Sa yali makawa.  It was lost  
     long  ago.      koro  makawa    former  village  location,  abandoned.  (Most  Fij ian  villages  have  re-located  
     since Cession. The reasons  are many:  the Pax Brittanica relieved villagers of the need for isolated and  
     fortified  locations.    New  locations  near  beaches,  rivers  or  roads  offered  better  access  to  markets  for  
     produce,  schools  and  clinics,  and  towns  where  jobs  might  be  available.  Sometimes  hurricanes  or  
     floods prompted re-location of villages, or this was done to separate and consolidate the various Chris- 
     tian  sects.   Idiom:   toa  makawa  unkind reference  to  a  woman  who  is  trying  to  act  like  a  very  young  
     woman  when  in  fact  she  is  middle-aged.    This  may  be  said jokingly,  or  may  be  serious  and  unkind.

     glaberrima, Rosaceae,  small white flowers  tinged with purple, useful for its straight trunk ; young trees  
     are  often  used  for  house  rafters  and  temporary  sheds  but  not  posts  in  the  ground.  Formerly  used  as  
     spars for canoe  sails  and  also  as poles  (ikara)  for poling boats because they  are  strong  and bend with- 
     out breaking. Twigs of makita leaves  are often used  for thatching of house  sidewalls because they  are  
     so  durable.   The  twigs  thrust  into  the house  walls,  that  are  often  made  of plaited bamboo  strips  these  
     days.  (That  flexible  bamboo  was  intro.  by  Europeans.)  Small  makita  branches,  leaves  attached,  were  
     used as brooms in the Eastern highlands of Viti Levu where there were no coconut palms to make sasa  
     brooms. Fragrant kernel of the nut  is grated  and used by  lowlanders to  scent  coconut oil  for body  ap- 
     plication,  and  after  adding  sour  citrus  juice,  used  by  highlanders  of  Viti  Levu  when  they  treat  their  
     hair.  The  fruit  is  not  eaten but  was used  for  making  a kind  of putty  for plugging  the  seams  of boats.   
     Syn. (Bua, Macuata) mala.   
mako    n.  a  common  tree,  Trichospermum  richii,  Tiliaceae,  timber  useful  as  casewood.  Formerly,  in  the  
     Viti  Levu highlands,  the  inner, bast  fibre  of  young  mako  was used  to  make  womens’  skirts,  and  as  a  
     binding  cord.    Gelatinous  inner  bark  is  used  to  arrest  diarrhea.  (It  is  more  traditional  than  the  now  
     commonly used  leaves  of  guava,  which  is  an  introduced  tree.)   The  tree  was  formerly used  for black  
     face-paint.  There  are  two  types,  mako  loa  (T.  calycatum)  and  mako  vula. Mako  vula has  a  very  light  
     coloured  trunk  that  rises  high  before  branching.  Flowers  are  cream  coloured.  Fij ians  might    perceive

     tree  Strebus  anthropophagorum,  Moraceae,  leaves  with  tenderising  qualities,  wrapped  around  human  
     corpses before cooking, and then eaten as  a vegetable with the cannibal meat. Botanist John Parham in  
     Plants  of   the Fij i Islands,  and  Capell  in his  Dictionary  are  copying  Seemann  when  they  list  the  name  
     malawaci for this plant. Botanist Al  Smith reports this  as  a mistake but the  few names he lists  are not  
     commonly  known.  Nonetheless,  the  plant  was  used  for  this  purpose.  Its  watery  or  white  latex  is  be- 
     lieved  to  have  tenderised  the  meat  (as  the  latex  of  papaya  does).    Another  such  plant  mentioned  by  
     Seemann  was  tudano,  now  classified  as  Omalanthus  nutans,  also has  a  corrosive  sap  and has had  the  
     same use. Another vegetable  also  wrapped  around corp ses  to be  cooked  and then  eaten with the meat  
     were the leaves of boro dina, Solanum uporu.

     mer  allies  are  said  to  be  malo  vata.  An  example  is  tribe  Nadakuni  at  village  Nasele  on  the  Waidina  
     River, related as malo vata to village Lutu-Wainibuka. The malo loincloth itself was an introduction to  
     the highlands, probably  from  Tonga  via  Verata,  and  was  made  of  barkcloth  masi  that  was  not  grown  
     and  made  at  the higher  elevations   (except  at  Navosa,  after being  introduced by  early  Tongan  settlers

     Waya Island before spreading widely.  Malolo also  an island name in the Mamanuca Group. As  a  Sa- 
     moan  word  “malolo”  can  mean  to  submit,  implying  some  ancient  defeat  and  submission,  or  simply  a  
     word implying  a resting place, including even death itself.  Malolo is  also  an expression heard in Lau  
     when a person retires from a kava-drinking circle, to move back and take a rest.   
      Idiom:   dre  ko Malolo   toward  sunset,  literally,  Malolo  island  is pulling,  Malolo being  in  the  far  west

     whale-tooth , the recipient may kneel or bow down and and clap the hands (cobo)  several times.  It is a

     tude  1000  meters,  Pleiogynium  timorense,  Anacardiaceae,  fls  white  to  yellow,  frts brown,  distinctive  
     scone-shaped  capsule  with  ridges  on  upper  surface  found  at  base  of  tree  all  year  round.  As  with  
     manawi  1, leaves are cooked for black hair dye. Also useful timber tree.  
manene    n.  female  private  parts  of  the  body,  a  word  perhaps  most  often  applied  to  children  by  caring  
     adults,  suggesting  that  the  girl  wash herself properly.  Derivation  of  the  word  may be  from  a  shellfish  
     that has a shape suggestive of that part of the female body.   
mani    particle  sometimes  adequately  translated  as  “thus”,  or  “then”,  as  an  unexpected  consequence.    It  
     precedes  a  verbal  form.    Kauta  mai  e  rua  na  kilo  suka  ke  mani  vo  na  ilavo,  qai  dua  na  uma  sovu.   
     Bring two kilos of sugar and then if there is money left, one bar of soap.  
manidia  (Eng.)  n.  manager.   
manileda   (Eng.)  n.  money-lender.  Some urban Fijians use moneylenders, who exact high rates of inter- 
     est though legally they  are not  supposed to exceed  12%.  Most borrowers  are Fij ian  civil  servants  and  
     people with a  steady job. Although lenders are required to be registered by government,  such activities  
     are  not  monitored.  Many  of  the  lenders  are  Fij ians  themselves.  Their  means  of  collection  can  include  
     violence, as in the overseas underworld.   
manini, maninitaka  v.  to conserve one’s resources, to use them wisely, sparingly.   
manioke  (Lau)    n.  cassava,  manioc,  from  an  American  Indian  name  introduced  by  Europeans,  now  the  
     major  starch-food  staple,  along  with  rice.  More  commonly  called  tavioka  in  Fij i.  In  Fiji  the  cultivars  
     are non-toxic. Overseas some are toxic.  
manipusi   (Eng.)   n.  mongoose,  introduced  to  the  larger  islands  (not  Taveuni  or  Lau).   It had  devastated  
     the population of birds  that nest on the ground  and is  always  a threat  to domestic chickens. Fij ian  su- 
     persitition may believe in good luck if  a mongoose runs  across the road from  left to right in front of  a  
     person or a vehicle, and bad luck if it crosses from right to left.    
maniwa  (Eng.)  n. manure. vakamaniwa-taka  to manure (it), put manure on .   
manulevu    n.  Swamp  Harrier,  Pacific  Harrier,  Circus  approximans.  Common,  now  extended  to  Tonga,  
     bird  of prey  mostly hovering  over  open  ground,  large  wide  wings  in  conspicuous  V  shape,  very  long  
     tail.  Eats  rats,  snakes,  lizards,  large  insects,  occasionally  fish,  and  carrion.  Nests  well  hidden  on  the  
     ground,  surviving the threat of  the mongoose.  Syn.   (West)   takubu.  (Nadro., Kadavu, Ra)  reba.   (Na- 
     mosi)  tuivucilevu.   (Rewa)  tivuci.  (Tonga)  taiseni.     
manumanu   n.   animal  (normally referring  to  a bird unless  the  context  suggests  another  type  of  animal,  
     such as iguana or snake).   manumanu vuka  lit. flying animal, i.e., specifically a bird.  manumanu dolo   
     crawling  creature,  snake,  worm.  When  associated  with  a  clan  or  tribe,  manumanu   means  their  sym- 
     bolic  animal or totem.  Na neitou manumanu na reba.  Our  symbolic  animal is the hawk .  As  an insult  
     Manumanu!  Beast !  Fij ians do not normally refer to fish as being animals.  The official Fij ian diction- 
     ary  Na  iVolavosa  ni  Viti  (2007, p.  358)  states  that  animals  (manumanu have  no  spirit  or  soul  (yalo),  
     which sounds rather dogmatic to an animal lover.  manumanu lailai (singular) or manumanu lalai (plu- 
     ral) usually refer  to insects.  manumanu midimidi  microbes, germs, bacteria, lit.  tiny  animals.  lewe ni  
     manumanu  meat.   
manumanu  n.  frill, as on a dress, other clothing, or a mat.   
manumanu  ni  cagi   n.   Frigate  Bird,  two  species,  the  much  more  common  Fregata  ariel,  Lesser  Frigate  
     Bird, with white patch on each side, and F. minor, Great Frigate Bird, that is all black in colour.  These  
     are  coastal  birds  that  rob  other  sea  birds  of  their  catch.    They  may  be  seen  as  far  as  75  miles  from  
     shore, more commonly within 50 miles  and is thus  a  sign of impending landfall for Polynesian  seafar- 
     ers.  To highlanders  in the mountains,  appearance of these birds indicates  the  coming of  storm winds,  
     when  the  frigate bird  takes refuge  in  the  interior.    In  courting,  a red  chin-pouch  may billow  out  con- 
     spicuously.  Syn. kasaqa.  
manumanu ni meke  n. A comic who livens up a group-dance  (meke) of men.  He is  a funny, very skilled  
    dancer, very adroit, agile, active,  spoofing the other dancers to have them perform at their peak.  With- 
    out such a comic, men ’s dances can become tiresome and boring to watch.     
manumanu soni  n. epilep sy.   
manumanu  tabu   n.   totemic  animal, bird  or  insect.  (There  can  also be  totemic plants  kau  tabu,  and  to- 
     temic  aquatic creatures  ika tabu.) Sacred totems are a feature of some Melanesian Fijians of Viti Levu,  
     especially in the highlands. They  are  a symbol of reproductive  ability, fertility , and  survival. There  are  
     no totems  in the more Polynesian kin-groups of the  coast  and  smaller islands but there is  sometimes  a  
     plant or creature, bird,  fish, plant, insect, of obj ect that has local  significance that may be iconic if not

     totemic.  (The  spirit god of  a tribe may take  the form of  an  animal or object.)  One  adds the word  tabu  
     only  if  necessary  to  make  the  context  clear  that  one  is  talking  of  a  sacred  totem.    In  most  cases  one  
     must  not pronounce  the  name  of  the  totem, be  it  animal, plant,  aquatic  creature  or,  in  some  cases,  an  
     inanimate obj ect such as a stone or piece of driftwood.      
manumanu vuka  n. bird.  The adj . vuka flying  is added only if necessary for clarity.  Normally the word  
     manumanu refers to birds but may refer  to other  animals,  especially now that  so many exist, imported  
     (cats, horses,  cattle,  goats,  mongoose,  toads).   Formerly  there  were  few  land  animals  other  than  igua- 
     nas and geckoes, frogs and salamanders.  Fij ians do not usually talk of fish as being animals.   
manuwa   (Eng.)  n. man-of-war, warship .   
maoli  (Lau , Rewa, Vuda, Nadroga, Serua, Naitasiri) n. papaya, an introduced fruit that thrives best in cal- 
     careous  soil,  often  near  concrete  foundations  of  houses.  Male  and  female  flowers  on  different  plants  
     with just  a few hermaphrodites. Lauans eat the cooked green fruit  as  a vegetable,  and may be referred  
     to jocularly  as bati maoli   "papaya-eaters".  The  sap  and leaves  are  sometimes used to  tenderise meat.  
     More  common name in Fiji is weleti,  in Lau  leweti  (pronounced  “leweji”)  in  an interesting reversal of  
     syllables.  
      Idiom: Maoli dada:  (Insulting): referring to a person from Lau, meaning lit. “soft papaya”.    
maopo  (Lau)  adj .  sensible and careful, of a  person.   
maoqani  (Eng.)  n.  large-leafed  mahogany,  Swietenia  macrophylla,  Central  and  South  America,  timber  
     tree  planted  by  Government  in  plantations  on  native  land.  While  Government  paid  all  the  costs  of  
     planting,  this has  led  to  disputes  as  to  ownership  of  the  timber.   Landowners  are  claiming  the  timber  
     should  belong  to  them.  Another  species,  S.  mahogoni,  with  smaller  leaves,  has  also  been  planted  in  
     Fiji.  
mape  (Eng.)  n. map.   
mapolo   (Eng.)  n. marble(s). Village  children often use the white  seeds of the  soni  shrub  as marbles. The  
     game is introduced. Syn. mavolo.  
maqa  (Vanua Levu, specifically Bua)  no, not.   
      Idiom:  Maqa na leqa!  Matua na raisi.  No problem ! Don ’t worry !  There is rice at hand.   
maqamaqa  n.  shorefront that are tidal flats.  At the Nadogra shore, sea salt is extracted at such locations.  
maqemaqe    (Eng.,  monkey)  adj .    agile  in  quick  movement,  usually  of  a  child  or  sportsman,  physically  
     evasive, difficult to catch.   
maqi,  maqitaka    v.    to  conserve,  to  be  very  sparing  in  sharing,  usually  of  something  in  short  supply.   
     mamaqi  adj .  selfish, stingy. Sharing is an important notion to Fij ians.  
maqo    (Eng.)  n.    mango,  an  introduced  fruit  from  India.  Fruits  seasonally  from  around  November  into  
     March,  earlier  in  the  West.  Mango  fruits  grow  more  successfully  and  earlier  in  the  dry  zones  (Nadi,  
     Labasa).  In wet areas such as Suva,  pounding rain often dislodges the flowers and tiny fruit, so that in  
     most  years  the  trees  are barren  of  fruit.    In  wet  climate  an  anthracnose  fungus  also  causes  flowers  to  
     drop.  Like  most  fruits,  the  mango  is  often  eaten by  Fijians  when  it  is hard  and  semi-ripe. With  a ripe  
     mango,  Fij ians  will  usually  bit  a  hole  at  one  end  and  suck  out  the  fruit.  They  refer  to  drinking  such  
     fruit, not eating it. They never peel  a mango the way Europeans do.  Varieties:   tabua   a large, curved  
     fruit with distinctive red colouring.  maqo  loa   a  superb var. of finest flavour, brilliant green when un- 
     ripe, turning darker  and dusky when fully ripe.  Indians have  special varieties  for making pickles.  For  
     the  Guj erati,  mango  leaves  have  symbolic,  religious  significance.  At  any  new  enterprise  the  leaves  
     would be hung about for a benign ambiance.  
maqosa  adj .  diligent and skilled. Syn. (Kadavu)  masokoi. (Cakau .)  masomasoko.  
maquru    adj .    of  Fij an  hair,  naturally  frizzled  with  stiffly  compact  coils,  distinguishing  characteristic  of  
     Viti  Levu  highlanders  (kaiColo).  Sometimes  laughingly  compared  to  steel  wool.    The  typical  hair  of  
     coastal Fij ians is  softer, known as ulu dina  “true” hair. In  areas of greatest Polynesian or Micronesian  
     influence,  in Lau  and parts of Cakaudrove, Fijian hair can be  softer yet,  some being wavy  and flatter,  
     known  as  ulu  wai  or  if  more  extremely  soft  and  long,  ulu  waiwaiya,  like  the  hair  of  eastern  Polyne- 
     sians, long and flowing.    
mara  (Archaic) n.  stench of  a decaying chiefly corpse,  and by ext. refers to  a place for keeping or buying  
     the  body.  The  word  does  not  have  the  unpleasant  connotation  of  the  English  equivalent.  It  has  been  
     used as a name for a chief.   
marama    n.  lady,  and  by  ext.,  queen,  in  playing  cards,  contrasted  with  turaga  (king),  as  in  queen  of  
     spades.

marau, marautaka  v. to enjoy, to be happy about (something).

     tained  ceremonial  function  for  the  Vusaratu.  They  are  of  Samoan  origin, previously  carpenters  called

     water  and  lime  (crimson)  which  is  one  I  have  not  actually  seen  done.    Authoress  Gale  Trexler  also  
     mentions the Upright Banana  (soaqa), young  shoots of this plantain  as  a purple dye. In Lau, red ochre  
     (umea), formed  into  spindle-shaped blocks  is famously obtained from Komo Island, which  itself does  
     not  produce  masi.      Several  varieties  of  the  masi  shrub  are  recognized:    masi  dina,  with  the  thickest  
     and  thus  the best  inner bark,  masi  damu,  with  an  outer bark  that  is  somewhat  auburn  instead  of  grey,  
     masi vutu the tallest masi, masi kau the most common variety . This was virtually the only cloth known  
     to  Fijians  before  the  advent  of  Manchester  cotton.  There  was  little  or  none  that  grew  in  upper  high- 
     lands, with the  single exception of one place in Navosa, introduced by Tongans who penetrated up  the  
     Sigatoka  River.  Some  Fijians  used  the  bark  of  the  breadfruit  tree  as  cloth,  but  many  Fijians  used  no  
     cloth  at  all.  Cotton is apparently an indigenous introduction but there  are no records of Fij ians using it  
     for cloth.  How or why cotton reached Fiji is a mystery.    
   masi toni  brown barkcloth from dipping (toni) in an infusion of mangrove bark, often used for burials.    
   masi  kesa  barkcloth  with  coloured patterns  in  some  local  style,  e.g.  Vatulele,  Moce, usually  in browns  
     and black,  often  via  stencils, but  from  Lau  can be  free-form  in  more  Tongan  style.   kesa   v.  to  apply  
     such colorant.   
   masi  kuvui   smoked  masi,  a  chiefly product, formerly used for fine turbans  and  shoulder-bands, usually  
     of  a dull yellowish colour.  On Vatulele, the masi kuvui is  actually  not usually  smoked but derives the  
     yellowish  colour  from  being  soaked  in  an  infusion  of  the  bark  of  the  kura  tree  and  bark  of  the  doi  
     shrub. The islands of Vatulele  and Moce are well known for their masi, with distinctive designs, Moce  
     using more detailed design and darker colours.  On Vatulele, the brown colour is from mangrove bark,  
     and  the  black  is  now  made  from  the  carbon  residue  of  diesel  oil.  For  commercial  purposes,  standard  
     sheets are made  12 feet x 2 feet.   
masi  ni  vanua   (Archaic)  n.  man  of  chiefly  rank  in  coastal  areas;  as  formal  dress he  might  wear  a bark- 
     cloth train behind his loincloth, and/or a covering (wabale) up to his lower chest or to one shoulder.  
masilini  (Eng.).  muslin (cloth).   
masima    n.  salt.  Available  formerly  only  by  trade  from  several  locations  around  the  coast,  at  Tavua,  Ba  
     and  Tailevu,  but  most  famously  at  Wai  District,  Nadroga:      Made  by  evaporation  on  tidal  flats  
     (maqamaqa),  and  then  boiling  over  an  open  fire  in  clay  pots  imported  from  Tavua,  Malolo  Group,  
     formed into blocks in cylindrical packages (na taba ni masima) of mangrove  tiri bark , ready for trans- 
     port or trade but meanwhile kept above  a fireplace to dry out.  By ultimate user, the block was  scraped  
     with  the  scrapings  added  into  water  before  use,  so  that  chunks  of  hand-held  food  might  be  dipped  
     (toni, tonia) in the saline solution.  No one sprinkled salt. Only a few decades ago, such block s (taba ni  
     masima)  were  sold  in  the  Suva  Public  Market.  They  were  sold  wrapped  around  in  a package  (iolo  ni  
     masima).  In  ceremonial  presentations,  ten  taba  ni  masima  would  be  referred  to  as  one  wai.    In  Lau,  
     seawater was used to flavour food, and was kept in coconut shells (p up u) as containers. Salt was rarely  
     available in the highlands but there  a  substitute,  sometimes  said to be  superior to  salt, was  a terrestrial

     Lau, bati ni  lovo)  and less inclusive than the tribe  (yavusa).  Mataqali have  a definite kin-group origin  
     whereas  the yavusa  are  often  the  result  of  political  aggregation,  only  sometimes  (as  with  super-tribe  
     Nabukebuke  in  Namosi,  or  super-tribe  Waimaro  in  the  Viti  Levu  highlands)  related  by  kinship.  The  
     distinction  is  often  blurred  in  Fij ian  society .    Historically,  Native  Land  Commissioner  Maxwell  at- 
     tempted to define  and  standardise these groupings for the purpose  of  assigning title to native lands. In  
     fact, Fijians do not much use these  terms in  identifying the level of their own  social group.  In eastern  
     coastal areas, mataqali usually serve definite roles  and functions in the larger society of the village and  
     the  Territory.   One  mataqali  may  serve  as  chiefs  (mataqali  vakaturaga),  another  clan  serve  as  elders

     who  empower  the  chiefs  (na  sau).  Other  functions  are  as  protocol  officers  and  emissaries  (matani- 
     vanua),  warriors  (bati),  priests  (bete),  fishermen  (gonedau),  boat  builders  (matai  or  mataisau),  com- 
     moners  (lewe-ni-vanua).    There  are  far  fewer  different  functions  in  the  highlands  where  the  "men ’s  
     house"  (bure)  was  the  basic  social  group  and  there  were  not  necessarily  any  tribes  (yavusa)  as  such,  
     and no use of the word mataqali  for clans. Highlander men of the bure all  slept together, side by side,  
     in  that  bure.  Women  and  children  slept  in  separate  houses.    Missionaries  later  required  men  to  live  
     with their wives and children.  
        One or more of the clans may be original  settlers  and landowners  (itaukei ni qele) who then  accepted  
     later  immigrants  as  chiefs,  as  warriors,  or  merely  as  dependents..  Fijians usually  feel  a  closer  attach- 
     ment to their clan, rather than the tribe but they do not often differentiate these  social divisions.  When  
     they  say  "We"  (Keitou,  referring  to  themselves,  their  own  people)  they  are  usually  speaking  of  their  
     clan.  Clans by  the  same  name  exist  in  various parts  of  Fiji.  They  may  not be  functionally related  any  
     more, having split off  some of their family groups who moved  away due to internicine disputes or in a  
     search  for  more  land.  Many  clans  have  become  extinct.  Others  have  been  functionally  merged  into  
     larger clans though land records may record them as distinct.   
mataqali    3.    n.  relationship  of  two  regions  where  the  people  may  refer  to  people  of  the  other  region  as  
     Mata  or  Mataqali  and  address  them  as  such.  Implied  is  a  common  origin.  Today  these  relationships,  
     formerly  specific,  have  now  become  generalised  between  to  whole  provinces,  for  example  Ra  Prov- 
     ince and Naitasiri Province.

       Idiom :  O sa matau  tiko ?  jocular, rhetorical question,  You think you can carry that off? What  makes  
     you think you can do that?   
matau  3.   n.  axe,  a  Polynesian  or  Proto-Polynesian  development,  only  as  specialised  adzes, used  mainly  
     for  boat-building.    Viti  Levu  highlanders  never  had  any  form  of  axe,  and  no  stone  implements  other  
     than  stone  sinkers  (vatu-kata-i-lawa)  for  river  nets  to  catch  the  fish  ika  loa  (Cestraeus  pliatilis)  as  
     communal  efforts.  Metal  axes  came  via  Tonga,  from  Tongans  and  early  European  traders  who  were  
     the  source.  In  converting  to  Methodist  Christianity,  Fij ians  were  often  given  a  metal  axe  (and  a piece  
     of cloth for clothing) as an incentive.  
      Idiom:   e  voleka  na  vanua  e  buli  tiko  kina  na  matau.  remote,  very  far  away ;  lit.  near  where  axes  are  
     made.     
matau  vatu  n.  stone-axe,  today  also  an  idiom  for  a person,  old-fashioned,  ignorant  ,  "stone  age ";   Fijian  
     youth  use  the  term,  referring  to  parents  and  elders  who  remain  in  the  villages  and  do  not  adjust  to  
     modern times, modern values.  Some of the earliest Fij ian  settlers of the highlands did not have  stone- 
     axes or any chisels. These so-called kaiColo were a pre-Stone Age, more Melanesian culture.

     Vakavanua) is incomplete, contains errors  and omissions, and has included a great deal of biased,  self- 
     interested  testimony  from  only  some  of  the  relevant  elders  who  were  present  at  the  hearings.  Elders  
     were  asked to record  and  swear to their testimony of land ownership  and history in what is referred to  
     as the  iTukutuku Raraba for  each tribe or clan . Deliberations have been difficult  and  sometimes quite  
     arbitrary in the face of conflicting versions of oral history, complexity of the issues involved,  and lim- 
     ited  time  for  deliberation.  In  some  case  the  N.L .C.  staff  have  not  had  the  local  knowledge  to  make  
     proper determinations. In earlier times the power of the club was the main determinant of chiefly titles  
     and  land  usage  rights.  Decisions  of  the  Commission  have  sometimes  become  influenced  by  political  
     considerations.  Beyond  summary  Reports  published  during  the  colonial  era,  records  are  now  closed,  
     unavailable  for  study.  Pandora’s  box  awaits  being  open  for  study  and  criticism.  At  the  present  time,  
     only elders of  a  specific  social group may gain  access  to records of their own group. Because knowl- 
     edgable  elders  are now  long dead,  there is really no hope  for easy  clarity.  Part of the problem  lies in  
     the  fact  that  Governor  Gordon  established  the  inflexible  legal  notion  that  all  land  had  originally  be- 
     longed  to  some  Fijian  social  group  which  is  very  far  from  the  actual  fact.  Fijian  settlements  moved  
     about  considerably  and  most  of  the  land  was  a  vast  no-man ’s  land,  too  dangerous  to  be  habitable.  
     Pressed  to  make  a  decision,  Commissioner  Maxwell  defined  the  primary  landholding  unit  to  be  the  
     clan  (mataqali)  and  that  simplification has  caused problems.  Social  divisions  and  the  names  for  them  
     differed  considerably  around  Fiji but  smaller  family units  would have been  more  appropriately  listed  
     as  custodians of the land. There was no permanent ownership in the  sense that Europeans understand,  
     only usufruct,  a right  to use  the  land.   It  is  a  further  complication  in  that  many  chiefs  and  elders  con- 
     sidered that they alone had total control of the land, including the right to  sell it, give it, or  assign it to  
     whomever they liked.  It has been  a fabrication to impose the notion that the land belonged to the peo- 
     ple.   Curiously  also,  the  notion persists,  even  today,  that  native  land  is  to remain  native  land,  forever  
     held  in  common.  In  fact  the  original  Land  Ordinance  of  1880  stipulates  that  communal  land  rights  
     would be  “desirable until the native race be ripe  for  a division of  such community rights  among indi- 
     viduals  .  .  .”  Governor Arthur Gordon never intended that native  land  should remain forever  commu- 
     nal property .  
Mata-veitokani  n.   Methodist group of youngsters who plan  some  activities  together. The purpose  is re- 
     ligious and social, involving girls and boys.   
matavulo  n. mask for the face.  Very  anciently crude masks were occasionally made of vegetation,  sticks  
     and leaves, sometimes with  added human hair, used by men in  some  ceremonial dances. Some  served  
     to conceal one’s identity in combat.  
matavura  n.  shore, place where boats approach and anchor. na matavura kei Suva .  the shore of Suva.   
matavutu  n., adj .  beauty, beautiful (usually referring to  a woman ’s face). vakamatavutu adv.  beautifully  
     (in this sense).   
mate  n.  death,  sickness, disease.  v. to die. Sa mate o koya  He/she is dead.  mate ni veiyacovi  venereal  
     disease.    mate  ni  suka    diabetes.    mate  ni  uto    heart  disease.    mate  ni  vakasama      mental  illness.    na  
     mate  na  AIDS      the  AIDS  disease.    Siga  ni  Mate    Good  Friday.    tauvimate    adj .,  n.    sick,  sickness.   
     Sickness often meant death to early Fij ians. They did not  always draw a  sharp distinction. People aged  
     or  very  ill,  no  longer  productive  in  society,  were  often  left  to  die  in  a  remote  place,  or  buried  alive.  
     Vale ni mate  hospital, more modernly called  Vale ni bula.  Syn.  bale  to die, of a chief.  By ext., mate   
     may mean exhausted, dead tired,  finished,  about to give up,  as from great effort, usually work or even  
     love-making when a person is sated.  Syn. (Respectful) toki yani.   
      Idiom:  mate  vakabalabala      to  die  without  progeny.  lit.  die  like  a  fern-tree  (balabala).  Fij ians  knew  
     that  a tree-fern has no seeds,  and has no suckers for propagation. They did not know of propagation by  
     spores.    
      Idiom:  Mate  na  toa,  kena  isau  na  bici.      The  exchange  is  not  equal.,  lit.  the  chicken  is  dead,  (given  
     away or stolen), and all that is given in return is a bici (small bird).   
      Idiom:   Sa  mate  vakadua!   He/she  was  completely  won  over,  fell  for  it hook,  line  and  sinker,  did  not  
     stand a chance, had to give in completely.   
     Idiom:  Mate o vale dua ka bula ko vale rua.  said good naturedly to someone invited to join in eating a  
     meal at someone else’s house, who declines with natural politeness. The jocular implication is that one  
     lives  well  who  can  eat  at  two  different houses but  might  die  of hunger  if  one  eats  only  at  one’s  own  
     family house.  
vakamate, vakamatea  v. to cause death, to kill.  E rawa ni veivakamatei.  It is possible to die from it. Au  
     a tovolea meu vakamatei au.   I tried to kill myself. (Suicide has been traditionally very rare among Fi- 
    jians.)

mateca   v.  to  desire,  lit.  to be  dying  for  (something  desired,  such  as  a  food,  some  object,  an  experience).  
     Usually it refers to  a loved one that  (figuratively) one would die for.  mateci koya  die for him/her.  In  
     the  highlands  of  Waimaro  this  word  becomes  matece.    On  seeing  a  girl  of  his  desire,  a  Fijian  youth  
     may pass his hand in  a  slice  across his own neck ;  the girl will understand that he pretends he will kill  
     himself if she does not yield to his affections.  There are the usual accompanying smiles and laughter.

     tion  can  occur  only  with  considerable  consumption  of  the  beverage  in  fairly  strong  form.    It  affects  
     physical  coordination  but  not  mental  acuity.  Some  people  become  addicted  to  yaqona  with  resulting  
     social irresponsibility and affliction of a skin condition called kanikani.

vakamau  (Tonga, “fakamau”) n., v .  formal and official marriage, to marry.  The suffix mau might imply  
     an  affirmation  in  Fijian  but  the  concept  and  this  word  were  introduced  from  Tonga,  where  the  word  
     originally referred  to  some  sort  of  inquiry  and became  adapted  for  this use  in  Christianity.  In  Fiji  the  
     older,  more  traditional  word  is  veitube,  and  also  vakawati.  Anciently  there  were no great formal mar- 
     riage ceremonies, though there might be  a feast when a chief took an important woman into his house- 
     hold.    Formerly,  the  main  point  was  for  the  man  to  provide  housing  for  the  woman  and  the  children  
     she might then have.  The word for this is vaka-vale-taka , to provide housing. Custom evolved to bring  
     a whaletooth to request the woman , or after  an elopement, to bring one in a ceremony of informing the  
     woman ’s parents,  and another, later, begging forgiveness bulubulu. Rejection of the suitor is indicated  
     by the return of  another whaletooth.  Many arrangements today are informal, outside the authority of a  
     church,  and  referred  to  as  vakawati.    o  rau  na  vakamau    the  newlywed  couple  (formally  married).  o  
     rau na veiwatini  the husband and wife (formally married or just living together).    
      Idiom:   tiko  vakaSuva  (or)  tiko  vakaSamoa   living  together,  of  man  and  woman,  without  a  formal  ar- 
     rangement. Certain liberties are possible in the city that would not be allowed in the village.    
maucokona  adj .  rich in the sense of being ample, meaningful, elaborate, as of a speech.  
maumau  adj .  spoiled, wasted (as of food, fuel, or some work).   
maumi   refers  to  a hilltop that is dry, barren.  Name of  a village near Bau Island. People of Maumi were  
     early settlers on Nayau Island, Lau Province.    
mautubu  v.  to sulk, pout.  
mauwe (or) maue adj .  noisy, of a crowd.

mavo  adj ., v. healed, to heal, of a cut, wound.  mavomavo dredre  difficult healing.  imavomavo  scar.   
mavoa  n.,  adj . injured, wounded  (person), damaged (goods).  mamavoavoa  very badly injured.  vakama- 
     voa-taka  to injure (someone).   
mavolo    (Eng.)  n.    marble(s).    veimavolo    n.  boys’  game  of  marbles.  Two  types:  in  one  there  is  a  circle  
     marked  on  the  ground,  in  the  other,  there  is  a  central pit  that  is  dug  that  is  called  a  “pillow”.   toa   n.  
     large marble used for shooting;  smallest marbes  are referred to  as de ni me  (goat droppings, from their  
     physical  shape  and  size)  or  “kind  one”  while  middle  sized  marbles  are  “kind  two”.   vana  na  mavolo    
     shoot the marble;  this is done with a thumb on the ground, forefinger  against the marble, flicking that  
     forefinger with the other hand. (It is not done by holding the hand as a fist  and flicking with the thumb  
     as  might  be  more  common  with  European  children .)  While  it  is  normal  for  the  thumb  to  be  on  the

     (“five-eighth”,  so  called),  or  from  a  standing position  (tu  cake).  Rules  are  to be  followed  strictly  and  
     violations may well lead to a scuffle.   
mavota  n.  timber  tree  endemic  to  Fiji,  only known  on  southern  coast  of  Viti  Levu,  Gonystylus punctatus  
     A.C.  Smith,  Gonystylaceae.  Globose  woody  fruit,  5-8  cm  diam.,  3-4  segments  with  smooth  seeds,  
     white fls clustered at the end of branches, thick shiny, simple, alternate leaves.  
mavu  n.  the pounded mash of cooked  starch-foods  (taro, breadfruit,  cassava, plantain), used to make Fi- 
     jian  puddings  (vakalolo).    waki,  wakia  na  mavu    mix  the  mavu  with  a  stick  iwaki.    Sa  wakiwaki  na  
     mavu   The mavu is  sticky, gummy.  Sa  tata-ciqiciqi na mavu  The mavu is lumpy.  mono, monoka na  
     mavu  form balls of the mavu.  kini, kinita na mavu  pinch off the mavu into balls.  The cultivated root- 
     crop yam uvi is never used for Fijian puddings. In coastal  areas and some small islands, uvi is the most  
     noble of the “true foods” kakana dina.     
mavu ni Toga  n. poisonous plant, Antiaris toxicaria var. macrophylla, shrub or tree in lowland rain forest  
     areas, the latex used for  arrows but mostly for  food poison, especially by priestly  castes in  coastal  ar- 
     eas  (such  as Tailevu) where the tree was often to be found growing  around temples  and  in villages in  
     the  1860s,  according  to  Seemann.    This  poison  was  introduced  from  Tonga  though  Tongans  never  
     used  it  on  arrows.  (And  Tongans  never used bows  and  arrows  in  war.)  The  more potent  variety  toxi- 
     caria of this species has been widely used as poison in Southeast Asia. In Fiji,  a more common poison  
     used by  super-tribe Waimaro  was  the  shrub  lobau,  formerly  mixed  with kava  to be  consumed unwit- 
     tingly  by  the  victim.  It  is  an  introduced  plant  related  to  Datura.  It  disables  a  man.  He  would  then  be  
     killed  with  a  club.    The  Fij ian  Dictionary  Na  iVolavosa  VakaViti  lists  Macaranga  vitiensis,  Euphor- 
     biaceae,  as having the name mavu ni Toga; I have been unaware of that as  a fact,  and it is not  so listed  
     as such in A . C. Smith Flora Vitiensis. Nonetheless, it may be correct.   
mawa v., n., adj .  stink, off-flavour, spoiled (of food).  Idiom: (Vulgar)  Gusu mawa!  stink mouth !   
mawe-na  n. tracks, trace,  as of  an  animal, or human,  as in  footprint.  Syn. we ni yava-na. May refer  scars

meke  n. Fijian form of exhibition dancing, usually by men or by women, with movements that  act out the  
     formal words of song  and chanting.  They celebrate historic of legendary events, or act out indigenous  
     activities,  including  household  tasks  or  war-like  posturing.  Rhymes  of  meke  are  simple,  little  more  
     than couplets, often with  forced final  syllables to match the rhyme.  Geraghty reports the Lauan word  
     for  rhyme  is  veikap akap a  but  that  would  be  unknown  to  almost  all  Fijians.  Meke  are  composed,  and  
     the  dancers  trained, by  a  dance-master  composer  (daunivucu),  who  is  greatly respected  and rewarded  
     for his  services.   Some words  and verses of  ancient meke  are no  longer understood.  And virtually no

     are  the  lakalaka,  and  seasea, of Tongan origin.  The  social dances, locally invented, Anglicised  shuf- 
     fle-dance taralala and modern dancing are not considered meke.  Fijians never had social dances, only  
     group exhibition dances, the meke, and the unique single dance to an evil spirit meke vula.    
meke-vula  n.  dance usually by a lone person, privately at night in the moonlight, often naked, dancing to

     happens to be edible and is eaten by pigeons,  and the wood was formerly used for making Fijian neck- 
     rests kali  (according to J. Parham). I have noticed flower buds forming in  September. The thin bark is  
     a  conspicuous  pinkish  tan  colour,  the  tender  leaves  pinnate.      A  few  quite  different  Fijian  plants  are  
     known as misimisi.  
misimisi   2.  n.   plant  commonly  growing  in  coastal  swampy  areas,  leaves used  as  sturdy,  durable  thatch

     buy tea. Citrus  limon. Flowers  and  fruits February through April, perhap s May. It is vaguely possible  
     (but  not  likely)  that  lemons  were  an  aboriginal  introduction;  the  species  is  indigenous  to  Southeast  
     Asia.  Lemons  (and the Tahiti  sweet orange) were introduced in  1832 by Vanderford  as mentioned by  
     John Parham. Vanderford was  an American officer on the brig Niagara, out of  Salem,  (later  a pilot on  
     the Wilkes expedition of  1840), according to W. Lawry in his book  Visit to the Friendly and Feej ee Is- 
     lands,  1850, as mentioned by R. A. Derrick in this A History of  Fij i.   Also known as moli karokaro  is  
     the introduced citron, C. medica,  with  a rough  skin,  as  indicated by the Fijian name.  This citron is  a  
     small fruit two to four inches in diameter, with a very sour pulp that tends to have a greenish colour.   
    moli taiti (or) moli dawa (or) moli sere n. Tahiti orange, a sweet orange, C. sinensis.     
    moli  kana  n.  shaddock,  pomelo,  Citrus  maxima  (=  C.  grandis),  Rutaceae,  semi-cultivated  around  old  
     settlement sites, two types, one with very large fruit, white flesh, (almost certainly  an  aboriginal intro- 
     duction)  and the other with grapefruit-sized fruit  and pinkish flesh. The pith  around the fruit is  a quite  
     bitter,  and  absolutely  all of  the  skin  and fibre  around the  segments  should be completely removed be- 
     fore  eating. Fijians used  to peel the large  fruit, keeping it whole,  and pass  a  twine through the  centre,  
     hanging  it  over  a  fireplace  for  a  few  days.  This  facilitates  removing  the  skin,  and  may  sweeten  the  
     fruit.    Fijians  used  juice  from  the  leaves  to  treat  external  infections  and  indeed,  the  plant  has  been  
     found to have  anti-microbial properties.  The grapefruit, C. x paradisi, is  apparently  a hybrid between  
     the  shaddock  and  C.  sinensis,  the  sweet  orange,  grown privately  in  Fiji but  not  commonly planted  or  
     used by  Fijians,  and having  no particular  Fijian  name.  John  Parham  mentions  it  is  very  vulnerable  to  
     Citrus canker.  
    moli kini  n. kumquat, introduced, Fortunella j aponica with round fruit,  and F.  margarita with the fruit  
     more oval.  F. j aponica is commonly grown.

    moli ni Batiri  n. Valencia-type juice-orange grown commercially at Batiri, Vanua Levu. This has been  
     a  government proj ect  with  a  troubled history  of  mismanagement.  The  Valencia  orange  is  sweetest  in  
     dry areas, but rather sour in the wet zone.  C. sinensis.   
     moli maderini  (Eng.)  mandarin, well liked by Fij ians.  C. reticulata.   
     moli kurukuru  n. inedible, C. macroptera,  size of  an orange, fruit  and leaves can form  a froth,  some- 
     times used by Fijians in washing their hair. The fruit, rather hard, formerly used  as  a ball in traditional  
     Fijian games.   
veimoli   (Archaic)  n .  young  man ’s  game,  two  opposing  lines  of  men  throwing  oranges  at  individuals  on  
     the  other  side.  When hit,  a  man  is  “out”.   By  contrast,  vaqiqimoli    was  a  match-making  game  with  a  
     line  of  girls  on  one  side  and  young  men  on  the  other.   They rolled  oranges  on  the  ground,  aiming  to- 
     ward the desired  potential partner.  Modernly, young Fijians choose other means of finding partners.

     verts.  There is a major temple in Suva, closed to all but members of that church.    
momo  n. mother's brother. noqu momo  my maternal uncle.   Such  an uncle has  serious obligations to the  
     niece or nephew who is said to be  "vasu" to him,  and make demands of him. The mother’s village has  
     such  obligations  in  the  case  of  chiefly  status.  These  days  the relationship  tends  to be reversed  as  vil- 
     lages  ask for contributions from their vasu.  A person  should treat the momo with respect  and a degree  
     of reserve.  The importance of the mother ’s village stems possibly from earlier, matrilineal Melanesian  
     society such as still exists in Macuata.  See gadi-na.

Momo  n.  title of  chiefly position in  western  Viti Levu,  such  as Ba Province. The implication is that of  a

      is  the  matter?   “The  House”  as  a  general  term,  the  concept,  would be A  Vale.   A  iValu    War  (as  a

      Idiom:  Naba!  After someone sneezes, this exclamation calls them to name  a number between one and  
      twenty  six.    For  example,  a  “four”  would  mean  the  letter  “E”,  suggesting  that  one  is  to  think  of  a  
      person whose name begins with an “E”.  There is really no point to this game of children.     
Naboro  n. place-name  some  17 km west of  Suva, referring to Fiji ’s main prison compound of  about 400

nabu  (Archaic)  n.  gift  brought  to  a  teller  of  tales,  ancient  stories,  usually  by  appreciative  youngsters,

       small  kava  root,  a  piece  of  food  or  anything  useful.    Radio  and  television  have  brought  an  end  to  
      many such occasions of story-telling.  Syn. (Lau) imanai.  
naga  (Archaic)  n.  stone-rimmed  compound  for  very  secret  indigenous  religious  ob servance,  especially  
      around the upper Wainimala River in the Viti Levu highlands. Some remnants may still be seen. Very

      rite of passage to adulthood.    
nagai  n.  edible  nut,  Canarium  spp.,  tall  forest  trees.  This  is  the  name  in  areas  of  Austronesian  language,

      though  most  Fijians  know  no  name  for  it.    The  Fijian  varieties  have  quite  small  nuts  that  are  little  
      used;  greatly  superior  varieties  are  to  be  found  west  of  Fiji.  The  nut  is  difficult  to  crack  without  
       smashing  the  kernel.    Known  as  galip  nut  (Papua  New  Guinea),  kanari  nut  (Indonesia),  pili  nut  
       (southeast Asia). In  some  areas of Melanesia (P .N.G., for example, but not Fiji) this nut was  a  starch- 
      food  staple  before  the  introduction  of  cassava.  There  have  been  modern  efforts  to  develop  it  
      commercially,  especially  in  the  Solomons  and  Vanuatu.  without  success  so  far.  It  is  very rich  in  oil  
      but the flavour of the nut is distinctive only if the kernel is toasted.    
naica   as in e naica ?   when? Used only in the form of  a question.  Also  ni naica when the event referred  
      to has not yet occured.  O na lako ni naica ?   When will you go?

Naita    n.    mutual  form  of  address  to  a  certain  group  of  people,  a  relationship  known  as  veitabani,  
      traditionally mutual branches or close  allies. The origin is theoretically based on their  ancestral  spirits  
      having  been  cross-cousins  veitavaleni.  One  may  refer  to  someone  as  being  “na  noqu  naita ”.  Two  
       such related  groups  are  the people  of  Kadavu  and  LomaiViti,  and  also  Kubuna  and  Burebesaga.   (A  
      different  interpretation  is  given  by  Nai  Volavosa  VakaViti,  p.  858;  there,  the  origin  is  said  to  have  
      been between  to peoples  who  were  formerly  at  war  with  each  other.)  Today ,  these  relationships  are  
      generalized  between  two  regions.  In  earlier  times,  the  two  places  were  more  limited  to  specific,  
       smaller locations. There may be a hard joking relationship between the two groups.    
inaki  n.  intention, purpose, plan.   
nakinaki v., n. to plan  to, intend to; intentions.  Era nakinaki mera  lai qoli.   They  (many) planned to go

      him.  na laba sega ni nakiti  manslaughter (not murder), unintentional killing.   
veinaki  v . to mutually intend or agree to (do something).   
naki ca, nakica-taka v. to have an evil purpose, intend to do evil (often associated with witchcraft).  Most  
      illness has been attributed to such witchcraft, and this is still a common belief. It may end in death.

      malaria  but  has  two  viral  diseases  resulting  from  a  female  mosquito  bite  (e  dua  ni  ikati  ni  namu),  
      dengue  fever  (deqe,  indigenous)  and  Ross  River  fever  (introduced  inadvertantly  from  Australia).  
      Only  one  bite  is  required.  The  disease  filariasis  (waqaqa)  is  caused  by  a  nematode  transmitted  by  
      three  Aedes  species  and  one  Culex  species;    continued  biting  over  some  ten  years  can  result  in  
      elephantiasis (tauna).    
      Idiom:    namu    person  who persistently  begs  and  “borrows”.  Like  the  mosquito,  they  are  a    pest.  See

nanai   n.   locust,  cicada,  scientific  name  Raeateana knowlesi  (or  Tibicen knowlesi),  that  as  nymphs  live

      parts. They emerge from the ground en masse  around September, climbing trees, moulting (shed their  
      hard skin)  and develop wings.  They live only two to three weeks, the female laying hundreds of eggs  
      on plant leaves. Shells of dead cicadas remain on the plants. The whole season lasts no more than two  
      months  with  cicadas  singing.  Their  appearance  is  noted  especially  in  certain parts  of  Navosa  and  in  
      Nuku  District  of  Serua  Province  (though  Serua  may  have  a  different  taxon;  there  are  some  20  
      endemic  species  in Fij i).  They  are legendary to the  Noemalu people.  Up the  Sigatoka valley, people  
      collect  nanai  as  they  are  drying  their  newly  formed  wings  and  tie  them  in  a  long  strings,  often  
      presented  to  neighbouring  villages.   Cooked,  they  are  considered  a  delicacy  that  signals  a  season  or  
      year  of  abundance  (yabaki  ni  sautu).    Nanai  may  be  cooked  in  bamboo  stems  and  served  with  
      coconut  cream,  though  in  early  days  there  were  no  coconuts  in  the highlands.  Women  may  also use  
      them  for  bait  when  fishing.  The  nanai  is  closely  related  to  the  cicada  maka,  the  Green  Cicada,  that  
      does not disappear.

     The Fij ian r is very strongly rolled, or trilled. In reciting the Fijian alphabet, r is pronounced as ra.    
  
Ra 1.  (followed by the name of an animal). In stories for children, as in Fijian or European fables, animals  
     may be referred to as Ra Vonu  Sir Turtle, Ra Qio  Sir Shark, and so on, for other animals.  
Ra  2. n.  name of a Fijian Province.   
Ra 3. or E ra or Era   they (many people, more than four), as subject of sentence.  
ira  them (many people), as the obj ect of a sentence.  
i  ra  or  e  ra   1. below.  E  vei?  I  ra,  ena  ruku  ni  teveli.  Where?   Down below, underneath  the  table.  The  
     opposite “up” is e cake, ena dela ni teveli, above, on top of the table.   
i ra or  e  ra  2. downwind, which usually means in  a westward direction.  The opposite “upwind”  e cake.  
     The  prevailing  tradewind  in  the  southern  hemisphere  comes  from  the  southeast.  In  the  northern  
     hemisphere it comes from the northeast. In between, in the central tropics, are the doldrums.  
vakara  westerly.  ena  Yasayasa  vakaRa   in  the Western  Division  (administrative  area  of  Fiji).  Originally,  
     the  closest  Fij ian  equivalent  of  the  west  was  in  fact  the  northwest,  downwind  of  the  tradewind  that  
     comes  from  the  southeast.    Fijians  now  modify  their  naming  of  directions  to  match  the  European  
     names of compass directions.  
raba  n.  width.  rabalailai  not wide enough.  E vica na kena raba ?  How wide is it?  raba levu  too wide.

rabe,  rabeta  3.   to  drink  a  cup  of yaqona  after  a  chief  (or person  of high  status)  as  a  symbol  of being  a  
     “second”  to  him.  For  a  chief,  this  is  usually  his  matanivuanua  who  drinks  after  him.  The  order  in  
     which  individuals  are  served  is  a  silent  statement  of  hierarchy.    Outside  of  highly  ceremonial  
     occasions,  the  senior person may defer to  someone  else  as  an indication of proper humility. Au  rabeti  
     koya.  I follow him/her (in order of being served).  Such ceremonial drinking of yaqona that re-affirms  
     the  social hierarchy  is  of  Tongan  innovation,  now  adopted  throughout  Fiji, but  in  earlier  times,  quite  
     foreign to highlanders and other indigenous Melanesian Fij ians.   
raberabe  n. a painful malady of the finger or toe with some swelling.  The skin becomes  separated, rather  
     like a blister  and pus  (nana) may emerge. This,  and a very few other real physical ailments  are known  
     as  “Fijian  ailments”  (tauvimate  vakaViti)  that  are  not  readily  distinguished  in  Western  medicine  by  
     having their own name.   See baubau, drimi.  Some Fij ians believe  witchcraft is the cause of  raberabe,  
     but this is a very common belief for virtually all illness or afflictions.     
rabo, rabota  v. to lash, as in the act of whipping, or firing off a sling. Sa raboti koya na vai.  The stingray  
     lashed him.  veirabo  lashing.  vakarabota na laca   flush out the sail (with the wind).   
raborabo-caka  n., v.  to punch out forcefully.  
irabo   n.  sling,  a  weapon  formerly used  in  war,  especially by  Melanesian  Fijians  for hurling  stones  quite  
     accurately.  The  ancient  skill  is  lost.  These  days  little use  is  made  of  slings,  only rarely by  children  at  
     play.    
radini(vale)  n.  housewife. radini sotia  soldier’s wife.    
Radini   (followed by place-name).  In  some places,  such  as  Levuka,  on  Lakeba  Island,  this  is  the  title  of  
     the  chief’s  wife,  as  in  Radini  Levuka,  wife  of  the  Tui  Levuka.  Radini  Waimaro  has  been  a  leading  
     chiefly designation in the highlands of Viti Levu, only known by the name of a sacred wooden figurine  
     of  super-tribe Waimaro. With  elaborate respect  some prominent positions  might justify  courtesy  such  
     as Radi ni talatala  wife of the preacher.  
rafolo  (Eng.) n.  raffle, a very common way of raising money in Fiji.  
Ragone    a  friendly  term  of  address  to  a  group  of  young  people  by  someone  senior.    For  youths,  Ra

rai  n.  opinion, personal view.  Na cava na nomu rai me baleta na  Yavutu.  What is your opionion of the  
     Constitution?

irara  (Archaic) n. indoor fire used for human warmth (rather than cooking).   tatalai v . to warm oneself in  
     this  way.  Formerly ,  in  a  men ’s  house,  there  might  be  a  fire  for  each  sleeping  section  for  one  or  two  
     men, especiall in the highlands.   
vakarara  v.  to warm oneself by a fire made for that purpose.   
ivakarara  (Archaic) n. frame, usually of bamboo, formerly used by men  as  a prop for their legs, to warm  
     them beside  a fire  in the  evening. This was  a  custom mainly in  the highlands of Viti Levu, where the  
     mountain  air  and  icy  streams  can  be  very  chilling.  (Temperatures  down  to  40  degrees  F.  may  occur  
     and icy hail is common.)  The eastern highland term is  iragiti.    lai vakarara  go prop up one's legs by  
     the fire to warm them. The custom has fallen into disuse because of the availability of clothes, but also  
     the  disappearance  of  men ’s houses  and  their  indoor, bedside  fires.    raraga  v.  to  warm  one’s body  in  
     this way.   
raraba  (or)  raba    n.,  adj .  width,  breadth,  the  totality  of  an  area;  common  or  widely  accepted.  Evica  na

rarakaka  smarting painfully, as from sunburn, scorching. Syn. rara.      
rarama  n., v.  to be lit up.  light (as opposed to darkness of the surroundings).   
vakararavi    adj .,  n .    dependent  (person,  people,  clans).  Clans  that  settled  later  at  a  village  (i.e.,  not  the  
     original  settlers  there)  have  often  been  accepted,  and  permitted  to  use  land,  while  remaining  in  a  
     somewhat  subservient,  dependent role.  Similarly  children  or  adults  may be  accepted  into  a household  
     and  supported.    While  this  is  often  a  healthy  relationship,  there  are  instances  of  exploitation  of  
     individuals who become unpaid servants. vakararavi vei au  dependent on me.  
raravisa,  raravisa    v.,  n .,  adj .,  n .    to  be  cutting,  strident,  domineering,  hurtful  and  harsh  in  behaviour,

Ratu  chiefly title for men used  alone  as  a form of  address, or in front of the chief’s name, only in certain  
     places    The  source  of  the  Fijian  title  is  Verata,  and  it  has  spread  throughout  Fiji  during  the  past  
     century, now applied to many local, minor chiefs as well  as the maj or ones.  The concept of his type of  
     title  is  from  Tonga.  Strictly  speaking,  the  title  belongs  only  in  Verata.    In  their  time,  Cakobau  or  
     Tanoa, his  father, never themselves used the title of Ratu.  It does not  appear with Cakobau ’s name or  
     any  other  chief’s  name  in  the  Deed  of  Cession  of  1874.    (Exceptionally,  in  the  1850s,  Ratu  Mara  
     Kapaiwai  was  one  of  the  few  who  did  use  the  word  Ratu ,  though  that  may  have  been  a  name  rather  
     than a title.)  It has been affixed to the names of Tanoa and Cakobau by later Fij ians, retroactively. The  
     Cakobau  Memorial  Church  on  Bau  Island  is  now referred  to  as  the  Ratu  Cakobau  Church.  Ratu  may  
     also be used  as  a personal  first  name  or  second  name.   The  title  may be  acquired  as part  of  a  chiefly  
     name,  by  a  namesake.    In  such  cases,  it  does  not  imply  chiefly  status.  Adi  is  the  female  equivalent,  
     sometimes heard as Yadi in Lau.    
Ratu-mai-Bulu   (Archaic)  n.  a principal  legendary  spirit  mainly  in  Tailevu,  Wainibuka,  LomaiViti  area,  
     residing  in  the  after-world until rising  temporarily  at  annual harvest  time  (yabaki)  around  December.  
     He was not worshipped but his  imagined return  to the underword  was celebrated with joy  and  a great  
     deal  of  noise  (drums,  shouting,  davui  trumpets). Bulu  implies  an  after-death  nether  world.  This  spirit  
     has been known as Latu-ni-pulu in Tonga.  
rau  1.  (pronoun)   they,  them  (two  of  them).   At  the beginning  of  a  sentence  rau   may  seen  as E  rau   or

     babies  who  are  often  fawned  over.  Young  urban  Fijians  have  adopted  romantic  kissing  but  there  is  
     never  any public demonstration of romantic  affection. Social kissing as  a greeting or farewell has been  
     copied  from  Europeans  by  some  Fijians.  regulaka  is  a  rather  modern  verb  for  stongly  emotional  
     kissing;  one  even  hears  a  syn.  kisilaka  from  the  English  kiss.  Traditionally,  the  Fijian  “kiss”  was  a

     tooth might serve for  a group of men, or  some men may bring some root of yaqona.  Women might be  
     expected  to  bring  a  mat  each  but  these  days  a  mat  might  serve  for  a  group  of  women.  The  actual  
     sniffing  of  a  corpse  is  falling  into  disuse, but  the  ceremony persists  as  a  first  step  in  the  sequence  of  
     ceremonies  at  a  death.  It  is  followed  by  the  somate  (burial  ceremony),  and  finally,  the  burua,  
     reciprocal  ceremony,  food  presentation  of  a  butchered  cow  and  other  uncooked  food  that  is  taken

     never  consumed  turmeric  except  in  purchased  curry  powder.  Syn.  cago  (ni  Viti).  The  “ni  Viti”  is  a

     S  is pronounced  as  an  almost hissing  sound.  In  speaking  English,  a  Fijian  would  normally pronounce  
the  word  boys  as  if  it  were  boyce.   In  western  Fiji  languages  and  dialects  it  is  common  for  the  letter  s  of  
standard Fijian to be replaced with  a c,  as in sici, Trochus  shellfish, to be heard as cici, and sucu, breast or  
born, as cucu.  In most  areas of Nadroga, the s may be replaced by an h which is an influence from Tonga;  
village Sanasana would be pronounced Hanahana, for example.   
  
sa  1.  particle  modifying  verb s  to  indicate  definiteness,  emphasis,  having  happened  or  sure  to  happen,  or

       Sa  lako  ko koya.   He/she has gone  already.  Sa  kana ?  Have you  already eaten?  Sa  lako ?  Are you  
       going  (just  now)?    This particle  stands  in  contrast  to  the particle  se  which  can  indicate present  and  
       continuing action, something that may happen or is likely to happen.  
Sa!  2.   interj ection  of  surprise,  shock,  disapproval,  an  expression  often  over-used  by people  learning  the  
       language. This same expression exists also in Tonga.  
sa      3.    n.  spear,  usually  now  referring  specifically  to  a  multi-pronged  spear  for  fish.  The  chiefly  titles  
       Vunisa  and Tunisa imply  a warlord, from the use of  spears (as told to me by the late Vunisa  at village  
       Weilagi, Taveuni).   dau vakasasa  pig-hunter who uses spears (and dogs).    
sa  4.  n.  a  sp. of tree, Parinara insularum, Chrysobalanaceae.  na vunisa  the  sa tree.  Red  sap . This  large

       wood is very hard to  cut when dry ,  so  for firewood Fijians will chop it up  soon  after felling the  tree.   
       In  season,  the  fruit  falls  to  the  ground,  and  the  crisp  flesh  may  be  eaten  raw  though  it  is  tough  to  
       chew.  Kernel  of  the  nut  is  not  eaten.  Bats  are  attracted  to  the  sweet-smelling  fruit  flesh  after  it  has  
       softened. Syn. sea.  
isa  1. n .  a sudden frightening wind that  strikes from one  side, usually around September-October, near the

       sometimes called a cat ’s paw from its dangerous speed and power.   
isa 2. n. partner (marriage, tennis, business), mate, a necessary second of two things (one shoe out a pair of  
       shoes),  a gift  made in exchange for  another,  a necessary opposite  of two  things,  as with  a rafter of  a

        Idiom:  vaka e siri na saku  fast (just as the saku skims on the surface).  
saku  2.    n.  any  of  the  large  billfish.  May  refer  to  a  swordfish  (saku  vorowaqa)  .  Also  sailfish,  sawfish  
      (sakulaya),  and/or  one  of  the  three  species  of  marlin :  Blue  marlin  (Makaira  nigricans),  Black  marlin  
      (M.  indica),  Striped  marlin  (Tetrapturus  audax).    Billfish  not  often  caught  by  Fijians  who  rarely

      people.) Namara warriors of Tailevu have been famous  for  their  expert  clubbing.  The implication is  
      to do a job efficiently, expertly, expeditiously .   
sakuku  (West)  n.  leper,  afflicted  with  leprosy ,  Hansen ’s  disease.    There  were  in  several  places  on  Viti  
      Levu  Island  special  stones  (vatu  ni  sakuku),  the  property  of  certain  clans  (mataqali).  Through  these  
      stones, heads of the clans claimed they could transmit leprosy when compensated to do so; this was  a  
      way  of  disposing  of  unwanted  people,  mafia  style.  Ref.:  D .  W.  Beckett,  Trans.  Fij i  Society ,  1966.  
      Syn. vukavuka.   
saku-loa   n. black  marlin,  Makaira  indica,  with  dark upper body.  There  are  two  other  spp.  of  marlin,  M.  
      nigricans  the  blue  marlin  and  the  somewhat  more  slender  Tertapturus  audax,  striped  marlin,  both  
      quite  similar  with  blue  upper  bodies;  there  is  no  tradition  or  consistency  in  their  specific  Fijian  
      names.  Marlin  have  often  been  caught  inadvertantly  by  net  fishermen;  others  are  caught  by  game  
      fishermen. They are sold as the fish in fish and chips, only sometimes identified as marlin .  
saku-saisai   n.  swordfish,  Xiphias  gladius,  not  trad.  caught by  Fijians,  and  not  common.  In  the  deep  sea,  
      swordfish  are  sometimes  seen  lying  on  their  sides,  sunning  themselves  on  the  surface.  They  are  not  
      dangerous  unless  attacked  or  caught  on  a  fishing  line.    Caught  only  by  gamefishers,  as  are  marlins.  
      Some  people  (including  this  author)  have  more  sympathy  for  these  noble  fish  than  for  the  game  
      fishermen.    
saku-voro-waqa  n.  sailfish,  Istiophorus  platypterus,  to  140  cm,  not  favoured  as  a  food  by  Europeans.  
      Flesh  is  often  riddled  with  the  holes  of  parasites.  The  name  refers  to  its  capability  of  breaking  up  
      (voro)  a boat  (waqa). The name  saku is  sometimes used.  Sailfish has  a huge blue-coloured dorsal fin  
      extending  along the back . It  eats  sardine-type fish,  encircling  schools of them, keeping them  close-in  
      together, then plunging into their midst,  swinging their beak like a  sword. Sailfish  are caught only by  
      game fishermen. Syn. sakulaya. laya is a noun and means “sail” in western Fiji.   
        Specific  Fij ian  names  of  sailfish,  swordfish,  marlin  all  have  the  prefix  saku—but  any  full  name  of  
      each  one  would  be  known  to  extremely  few  Fij ians  and  there  is  little  consistency  of  names,  some  
      being modernisms decided by Fisheries Dept. Reason is that Fijians were not deep-sea fishermen and  
      virtually  never  caught  these  fish.  They  rarely,  in  fact,  ever  saw  them.  They  are  not  usually  at  the  
      surface of the sea.  
sakure v.  to  shake, rumble,  tremble,  shudder,  as  a  stomach might,  or  an earthquake, or  a motor  car out of  
      fuel, or a house in very strong gusts of wind. See kure, kuretaka.    
sakulevu, sakulevutaka  v.  to be careless, neglectful in responsibilities.

      communications   between   two   places   or   people,   and   extremely   important   concept   to   Fijian  
      traditionalists.   
       Idiom :  E tubua na sala ki na nona koro   He/she has lost connection to his village, never visits it (lit.  
      the  path  to  his/her  village  is  overgrown).    For  a  person  living  away,  it  is  sometimes  a  burden  to  
      maintain relations with the village, with various demands from relatives.  And these days, the village  
      may  not  be  so  relevant  as  many  Fij ians  are  pre-occupied  with  their  lives  in  towns  or  other  distant  
      places of employment. To renew relations to one ’s village is cara sala  to “clear or sweep the path” to  
      the village.  It can be an expensive process, requiring gifts of goods, and time spent. A Fij ian ’s village  
      is almost always demanding support.     
sala 2. n. By extension, sala may mean figuratively, the way or means (the path) to accomplish something,  
      or may mean to extend, as in extending the hand or leg.     
salabogi  v.  set  out  on  a  trip  in  the  afternoon,  and  thus  travel  or  arrive  at  night.  The  personal  name  Meli  
      Salabogi is well known in the lineage of the chiefly Gonesau at Nokorotubu, Ra Province.   
sala ni cagi  n. windpipe but more generally, throat and bronchial tubes, lit. path of the breath.  
sala ni dra  n. vein or  artery  (human or  animal body).  dra  blood. Fijians made no distinction between  a  
      vein (for blood returning to the heart) and an artery (for blood leaving the heart).

sala-ni-mi  n. urinary tract, a newly created word.  
sala  ni  valelailai    n.    colon  (human  or  animal  body).  valelailai    n.  toilet,  a  concept  introduced  by  
      Europeans.  
sala  ni  ivalu   n.  lit. path  of  war,  meaning  the  specific  social  connections between  two  or  more places  in  
      preparation  for  making  war.  Formal  communications  should  pass  through  various  specific  kin- 
      groups, tribes or villages. See also sala ni vanua.  
sala  ni  vanua  n.  traditional  approach  in  communicating  formally  with  another  tribe  or  kin-group  on  
      matters  other  than  war.   Communications  should pass  through  certain  specific people  as  a  matter  of  
      formality.   
sala ni volivoli  n. ancient term for a traditional route whereby goods passed in tribute, and perhap s also in  
      a  form  of  exchange  that  by-passed  the  formal,  highly  social  and  ceremonial  exchanges  of  the  
      traditional solevu.  From this activity, there are  some places named  Volivoli.  Laucala  and then Verata  
      were  a  couple  of  the  first  major  territories  to  establish  such  a  system  over  an  extensive  area  that  
      included parts of Vanua Levu.  Bau later established such a system, as did Burebesaga.   
salawai  n., adj .  reached by water, usually of an isolated village with no good access by road. An example  
      is  village  Qoma,  formerly  turtle  fishermen  for  Verata,  located  on  two  very  small  islands  off  the  
      northern coast of Tailevu.    
Sala  ni  Yalo    n.  “Path  of  Spirits”,  a  legendary  and  real  path  of  early  migration  on  Viti  Levu.  It  was  
      supposed  that  after  death  spirits  would  return  on  this  same  path.    On  Viti  Levu,  one  established  
      formal path led  southward down from Ra  and the eastern highlands to the  coast  around Veisari. This  
      mountain range down the eastern coast of Viti Levu was called Tualeita.  Some would claim it begins  
      not far from Vuda, far in the west of Viti Levu, and passed through the Nakauvadra mountain range.  
sala, salaga  v. to wrap  around,  as leaves, vines or creepers, or paper, in making  a parcel, or  (formerly) to  
      wrap a chiefly turban (isala) of barkcloth on the head.

      barkcloth  masi,  in  coastal  and  small  island  areas,  worn  only  by  chiefs.  Missionaries  caused  the  
      custom  to be discontinued.  The use of  such hats or  turbans occurs these days only  at  the installation  
      of  certain  chiefs.  Today,  rain-hats  may  be  improvised  with  plastic  bags,  towels,  cardboard  cartons,  
      the leaves of plaintain.   
isalasala  n.  wrapped  parcel  of  leaves  containing  food  such  as  fish  to  be  cooked  in  the  earth  oven.   
      isalasala  ika    n.  long,  leaf-wrapped  parcel  of  fish.  Syn.  ikovu,  though  this  is  a  round,  bud-shaped  
      parcel.   
vakasala-taka    v.  to  advise.    ivakasala    advice.    daunivakasala    advisor.  Daunivakasala  Levu  ni  Veika  
      Vakalawa  Solicitor General.   
salala  1.  n.  fish,  long-j awed  mackerel,  Rastrelliger kanagurta,  edible but  not  greatly  appreciated because  
      of the lack of meat in the head. Fij ians appreciate the head of the fish as having more flavour than the  
      other flesh ; the head will often be offered to a guest. This  seasonal  silver fish lives close to  shore  and  
      travels in fairly fast-moving schools.

       Idiom :  ulu salala   empty-headed, stupid.    
salala  2.  n.  cultivar of voivoi pandanus leaf that has long leaves and no thorns along the edge of the leaf.  
      Much  easier to handle than the regular, prickly  voivoi but  the quality of  the leaf  is not  as good,  so it  
      does not displace the regular cultivar. Syn. voivoi ni Rotuma.   
salato  1.  n.  a  harmful  wild  shrub  or  tree  of  the  central  South  Seas,  10  to  15  meters  high,  Dendrocnide  
      harveyi,  Urticaceae,  with  stinging  hairs  on  the  margins  of  the  leaves  and  sap  that  stings  very  
      irritatingly. The irritation is  aggravated by water. The itching burn occurs within half  a minute but the  
      after-burn  may  recur  for  months.  Veins  on  underside  of  young  lvs  are  purple  or  reddish.  The  totem  
      plant  of  some  highlanders  where  the  name  must  not  be  mentioned.  Thrives  best  in  secondary  
      vegetation, identified by heart-shaped  leaves with finely  serrated edges,  and white  to cream  coloured  
      flowers,  small  (under  5  cm)  forming  white,  thin-skinned  single-seeded  fruit.  Formerly  planted  
      deliberately at perimeter of some fortified villages as defensive device.   
salato 2. n.  edible small coloured j ellyfish with long stinging thread, Physalia physalis.  
salavata  v.  to go along together. vata together.   
sala waqa v.  to go by boat.    
salayame v. to have to tongue hanging out,  as  a dog does when too hot.  (Dogs cannot perspire; cooling is  
      done  by  keeping  the  mouth  open  and  by  drinking  water.)  By  comparison,  darayame  usually  just  
      refers to sticking out the tongue, as a child might do in teasing.  yame  tongue.  
salayava  v.  to extend the leg(s).  yava  leg(s).  This may be done as a person excuses himself after a meal  
      and shifts where his back will be against the wall, relaxing. Syn. dodoyava.   
sali,  salia  (or)  saliva  v.  to  flow  down    (current  of  water),  or  flow  through  as  of  a  narrow  channel,  or  
      opening of a reef, where the tidal current flows through.  Also to droop down (thatching from the roof  
      of a Fij ian house).  Salia can be the name of a village.  
salisali  n. opening through the reef of  a lagoon, that  serves  a path or channel  for the passage of boats, or  
      for the movement of fish with the tide.    
isalisali-ni-wai n. gutter, or drain as passage for water flow. This is a fairly modern word.   
salu  n. traditional  specialty food; for people of the warrior castes, usually inland, this is mainly pork since  
      they  are  considered  to  have  wild  pig  easily  accessible;  for  coastal    people  it  is  mainly  seafood,  and  
      coconut dishes. One must offer one's  salu  to visitors who have  a different salu,  and one may not eat  
      one's own salu  in their presence. The rule  is  still fairly  strictly maintained even by urban Fijians  and  
      even if the Fijians live overseas. Nothing need be said, and the foreigner will probably notice nothing.  
      Curiously,  as people have  so  often  moved  and resettled,  the  traditional  warriors  may  actually reside  
      near  the  sea,  the  coastal  people  moved  inland;  they  nonetheless  retain  the  old  customs.    isasalu   
      delicacy.  veisasalu ni wai tui   seafood delicacies.  
saluaki   adj .  scented.   isaluaki   scent used  to  perfume  oil.  A popular  Fijian  scent  is  mokosoi  flowers but

isaluaki  1.  n.  scent, fragrance; this now includes commercial perfume.  
isaluaki  2.  n.  condiment,  spice,  added to  food. This  is  modern usage. Fij ians  anciently used virtually no  
      condiments  other  than  salt  or  a  sweetener  (such  as  sugar  cane  or  masawe).  In  the  highlands  the  
      terrestrial  fern  waruta  was  used  and  often  preferred  to  salt  that  was  rarely  available  to  them.  
      Modernly, Fij ians use cane sugar, chilli pepper, salt and pepper but few other condiments.  
saluka v. to blow the nose Fijian-style, without the benefit of  a handkerchief, holding  a finger  against one  
      nostril.  For  young  children,  the  snot  (luka)  will  be  wiped  away  onto  the  child’s  clothing.    Adults  
      sometimes  do  the  same,  using  the  shirt  or  T-shirt.  The  handkerchief  is  an  introduced  concept.  Syn.  
      wadruluka.   
salulu  adj . wrinkled, loose, drooping, of human skin and flesh, usually from  aging.  wa-salulu  extremely  
      wrinkled.   See sanuki.   
salusalu  n.  massive  and  heavy  garland  of  flowers  and  sweet-scented  leaves,  framed  in  woven  fibre  of  
      pandanus  and/or  hibiscus,  presented  to  distinguished  guests  at  formal  occasions.  The  flowers  often  
      include  bua  ni  Viti.      cori  salusalu      to  string  a  garland.    Era  vakasalusalu  kece.      They  (many)  all  
      wore floral garlands.   
      Idiom:   vakaciri  salusalu   v.   to  throw  flowers  onto  the  sea  for  loved  ones  departing  in  a boat.   This  
      custom  is  not  truly  Fij ian  in  origin.  It  was  perhaps  introduced  from  Polynesia.  As  a  practice,  it  
      probably reached its peak with commercial steamships, especially the Matson Line, in the  1930s with  
      the Mariposa and Monterey sailing through the South Pacific.     
saluma  (Lau) v. to wear  something  around the neck, usually  a garland.   Syn.  taubena.  vakasaluma  v.  to  
      place something around a person ’s neck, usually a garland.

      some  by  physical  means.  Most  of  the  herbal  concoctions  are  ineffectual  or  dangerous.  Collected  by  
      the  present  author,  they  have  been  submitted  to  scientific  research  by  a  major  pharmaceutical

saumure  n.  iguana.  Two  species  in  Fiji,  the  Banded  Iguana    (Brachylophus  fasciatus)  and  the  Crested  
      Iguana  (B .  vitiensis),  though  the  two  species  may  yet  be  recombined.    Among  the  Banded  Iguana,  
      only  the  male  is  banded,  with  green  and  grey  bands,  while  the  female  is  totally  green.  The  species  
      exists  only  in  Fiji  and  Tonga  and  the  early  origin  of  any  iguana  is  certainly  from  the  very  distant  
      continent of America. The Crested Iguana was discovered by John Gibbons in  1979. Both species eat  
      plants,  including  fruit  and  flowers,  as  well  as  insects.    Eggs  are  laid  in  damp  ground  usually  at  the  
      base  of  trees,  where  they  spend  much  of  their  time.  Iguanas  are  found  in  Yasawa  and  Mamanuca  
      islands  and rarely on Viti Levu.  (In the Namosi jungle at Wainadoi I have observed  a major breeding  
      place but have  only  ever  seen  the  iguanas  there  twice.)  They  are  often  immobile,  camouflaged,  and  
      may be high up in forest vegetation.  A wildlife sanctuary has been established for the Crested Iguana  
      on  the  70  ha  island  Yadua  Taba  located  2 1  km  west  of  Naicobocobo,  Vanua  Levu.  It  has  been  
      necessary  to  pay  the  chief  of  the  native  landowners,    the  Buli  Raviravi,  a  “goodwill”  and  informal  
      lease payment of F$1500 a year, which was increased to $2,500 in  1990 and formalized  as a contract  
      with the National Trust.  A final lease was formalized  after  a further necessary $50,000 payment was  
      made  to  the  landowning  unit  in  the  year  2000.    Syn.  vokai,  as  used  by  some  Fij ians,  but  vokai  
      properly  refers  only  to  the  forest  gecko,  much  more  commonly  seen  in  the  bush  than  iguanas  are.   
      Forest  geckos  are  a  smaller  reptile  of  which  there  are  several  species  in  Fij i,  some  as  long  as  seven  
      inches.  Most  were  commonly  eaten  by  Viti  Levu  highlanders.    The  two  common  household  lizards

      personal  toilet.    na  sasauni    the  cosmetics,  toilet  article.  In  early  times  cosmetic  attention  was  only  
      even  given  to  the  hair  with  dyes,  bleaches  and  attention  to  lice.  In  areas  of  Polynesian  influence,

      house-site  for  fear  of body parts being  taken  for  witchcraft.  Sometimes bodies  were hidden  away  in  
      caves.  There  were  no  elaborate  funeral  actions  except  for  chiefs,  when  it  was  mainly  a  matter  of  
      strangling  of  wives  and  chopping  of  little  fingers.  For  most  Fijians  there  was  no  such  thing  as  a

      old  barkcloth,  whale  teeth  that  might  have  been  related  to  devilish  practises.  Some  Fijians  believe  
      such  a  cleansing  improves  the  school performance  of  their  children  and  many  other  aspects  of  their  
      village  life,  bringing  them  good  fortune,  bringing  them  into  God’s  good  graces.  Wainibuka  went  
      through  such  a  cleansing  in  the  year  200 1.  Preacher  Jokatama  Rabukuivalu has been  a  leader  of  this  
      movement.

sere-na  n.  breast, chest.   
Serene   (Eng.  Sydney)   the  city of  Sydney but  also  several varieties of pineapple of the  Smooth Cayenne  
      type,  larger  than  the  older,  more  familiar  Ripley  Queen  types,  and  with  fewer prickles  on  the  leaves  
      (and  thus  easier  to handle).  There  are  about  three  types  of  Serene  pineapple  differing  in  size,  colour  
      of fruit at maturity, and the presence or ab sence of tiny seeds.   
serevasi  (Archaic)    n,  traditional  form  of  singing  chant,  now  long  forgotten  by  virtually  all  Fijians.  
      Formerly, usually performed by one man in a relaxed position, even lying down, sometimes joined by  
      a  second  man  who  may  intone  a  wordless  accompaniment.  The  words  come  from  a  sort  of  trance,  
      spontaneous  and unique  to  that  occasion,  thoughts  that pass  throught  the performer ’s  mind,  with  no  
      rhyming necessary . There may be tacit messages in the content but nothing will be discussed later by  
      the performer.  (There  might be  an  analogy  with  the  concept  of  modern-day  “rap” by predominantly  
      black American performers,  though serevasi is not performed  in  an excited  state.)  The occurence of  
      serevasi  is  after  some  task  that required  exertion,  such  as  weeding,  or  digging  a  drainage  ditch .  It  is  
      done  at  a period of relaxation. An  audience of  sorts  might gather  around  and listen,  silently. The old  
      word  vasi  implies  a  cleaning  off,  or  peeling  off  the  surface  or  skin  of  some  food,  and  is  thus  used  
      figuratively  or  symbolically  in  the  word  serevasi.  It  is  also  used  for  removal  of  fish  flesh  from  the  
      bones.  Solo  Bulicokooko  discusses  serevasi  at  length  with  me.  He  wrote  a  small book  Serekali  and  
      Serevasi,  Lotu  Pacifica,  1988,  81  pp.,    illustrating  both  concepts.  Semiti  Kaisau  wrote  briefly  about  
      serevasi in Essays on Pacif ic L iterature, Fiji Museum,  1978, p. 29. But Kaisau speaks of the serevasi  
      as being sacred which is probably not at all a necessary component.  
seru, seruta  (Polynesia) v. to comb . Syn. kava (an earlier Fij ian word).  serutavi, serutavia  comb and pat  
      into  shape  (head  of  hair).    tavi,  tavia    to  pat  with  the  hand.    ulu  medre    entangled  hair  (that  needs  
      combing).  Syn. (Rewa, Kadavu)  vani, vania.   
iseru   (Polynesia)  n.   comb .  Formerly, keeping  a  comb  in  the hair  was  a  mark  of  chiefly  rank  or  warrior  
      prowess.  Originally  this  was  a  single  spike, partly  as  a head-scratcher,  and  means  of  loosening  tight  
      coils of hair. Syn. ikava.   iserukau  n. wooden comb Fiji style with long prongs, a concept introduced  
      only  in  the  1830s,  according  to  Fergus  Clunie.    iserutaku    tortoise-shell  comb  (lit.  turtle-shell),  
      European  style  for  soft  hair,  these  days  made  of  plastic.    The  honorific  name  Seru  was  granted  to  
      warriors  of  distinction.  Now  it  is  a  common  first  name  as  most  Fijians  have  adopted  the  English  
      system of  a first name  and  a  surname.  na  iseruseru   the  combing,  manner or  style of combing.  Syn.  
      (Rewa, Kadavu) ivani.

sesewa  adj . n.  scatter-brained, unthinking, weak-willed,  stupid, going astray.  Au sa sesewa sara koi au   I  
      have been stupid, made a bad mistake.   
“Set!”   (Eng.)   Set ! Everything is ready,  everything is okay.  It is  as good  as done. I understand what is to  
      be  done  and  will  do  it.  Often  heard  as  “Set  tiko !”  Everything  okay,  ready.  A  very  modern  (early  
      2009),  and  perhaps  fleeting  expression  is  “I ’m  set  with  Digicel !”,  parroting  a  Digicel  commercial  
      slogan. This is said within the context of youngsters’ Fijian speech.  
Setani  (Eng.) n.  Satan.   P ielisip up i   Beelzebub.  Syn. (R. Catholic)  Satani.   
Seti!  exclamation of mild reproach.   
seu  if I, a contraction of  se au,  as in a statement seu lako se sega. Commonly seen as se ’u.   
seu, seuta  v.  to  scratch, as  a hen does, or a dog pawing the ground for a resting place.  Also, to  scoop,  as  
      one might scoop sand with the hand.  seseu  such action  emphatic or continued.

      are sometimes named Seuvou, or similarly, Korovou.

      Fijians  are  told  how  much  money  they  must  give.  Solicitation  is  made  as  well  to  those  who  have  
      married  someone from the village. Collection procedures  are often relentless.  If  a Fijian fails to pay,  
      he or she could become estranged from the village.   na isolisoli mai vua na Kalou  the gift from God.

      weaving,  or  of  sinnet  (magimagi),  used  in  decorative  bindings  of  house-timbers,  or  wooden  clubs.  
      After  then being  rinsed  in  fresh  water,  the  material  is  cooked  with  certain  leaves,  candlenut  (lauci),  
      tavola,  koka,  kalabuci, to fix  the colour, then washed  again  and dried by hanging up outdoors. There

      Literally,  in  Vanua  Levu,  so  na  ua  means  the  tide  is  full.    Sa  so  mai  na  ua.    The  tide  is  rising.    In  
      Tailevu,  mati  ruku  means  low  tide  (usually  referring  to  the  early  morning),  which  has  taken  on  the  
      same  meaning  of  daffy,  when  speaking  about  an  odd  person.    It  is  believed  that  some  people’s  
      behaviour changes with the tide, be it full or low.  One may  ask then, when someone  acts crazily, if it  
      is low tide or high tide. The effect of the tide on people is remarked upon particularly in Vanua Levu,  
      Nasavusavu District, especially villages Vivili and Waivunia. Those locals have  a reputation of being  
      daffy in relation to the tide. This is the source of many jokes and funny stories. Syn. (Colo East) dale,  
      sauvou.  2. not commonly, but sonaua can occasionally have vulgar connotations when referring to  a  
      person,  simply  because  of  the  coincidence  that  the  sona  part  of  the  word  means  rectum.  Vulgarity  
      will be indicated by context and tone of voice.   
soni, sonita v. to pierce or to prick with  a  sharp object, usually  a knife or  a needle in these modern times.

      to remove the tiny thorns  from  edges of pandanus voivoi  leaf in preparation for  stretching it, prior to

soni   n.  common  climbing  coastal  shrub,  Caesalpinia  spp.,  yellow  flowers  and  seeds,  thorns  and prickles

      yaqona  may also refer to pouring out yaqona into the sea  as an offering to Dakuwaqa, the shark god.  
      Such  an  offering by  divers  is  intended  to retain  Dakuwaqa’s protection  from  shark  attack,  though  to  
      gain  that protection,  divers  must  also have restrained  from recent  amorous  adventures.  I have  a  scar

      raised by rubbing the leaves of either  species.  The tiny purple fruits of Koster’s Curse happen also to

      subtropics,  sometimes  seen  lying  on  its  side,  basking  in  the  sun  (just  as  a  swordfish  does).  It  may  
      weigh  more  than  two  tonnes.  Inoffensive,  and  unafraid  of  humans,  the  sunfish  has  a  diet  of  kelp,  
      algae  and plankton,  small  fish  and  crustaceans.    The  flesh  tends  to be  very  white  or pink, but  tough

      mortal  offense.  Sneezing  is  still  somewhat  impolite,  but  is  now  perfunctorily  excused  by  the  
      exclamation  Bula!.  (Live !).    One  replies  Moli!  to  express  gratitude  that  one’s  life  is  spared.  The  
      verbal  exchange  is  good  natured.  If  the  sneezing  is repeated  a  few  times,  the humorous  exclamation  
      may be Mate! Die !    
      Idiom:    Sa  suruta  na  vusi.      lit.  The  cat  has  sneezed  on  it,  meaning  that  some  plan  went  wrong  by

      Rewa Province but formerly allied to Bau. It is also the name of the tribe of the Tui Taveuni.   
suvania   (Eng.)   souvenir.  Many  of  the  Fij i  souvenirs  sold  in  tourist  gift  shops  originate  from  Indonesia,  
      the  Philippines  (examples  are  shell  necklaces),  or  are  manufactured  in  Australia.  Modernly  carved  
      warclubs  are  one  of  the  few  types  of  souvenirs  made  in  Fiji,  some  of  them  very  well  done  by  
      traditional  woodcarvers  but  many  are  crudely  made  imitations.  Carved  wooden  masks  are  fake

suvi,  suvia  (or)  suvisuvia  v .  to  cut  into  large  pieces,  usually  a  root-crop  such  as  yam,    sweet  potato,  
      breadfruit, potato, usually before cooking.   isuvisuvi  chunk, as potato cut up for a for a stew.   
suvu    (Eng.)    soup.  Soup  is  customarily  slurped,  even  if  a  spoon  is  used.  (Spoon  is  a  modernism).  As  a  
      separately cooked dish,  soup was known only in coastal  areas, not  in the highlands where there were  
      virtually  no  clay  pots.  The  main  soup  was  fish  broth,  usually  called  wai  buta  or  wai  su.  Fish  is  the  
      only  food  that  was  sometimes boiled.  (The  only  exception  is human bodies boiled  in  whalers’  giant  
      iron pots  that had previously been used  to reduce whale blubber.)   In the  lowlands, virtually  all  food  
      was  steamed  in huge  clay pots.  It  was  not boiled.   Or  food  was  grilled  over  a  fire,  or  cooked  in  the  
      earth  oven  (lovo),  though  the  earth  oven  was  unknown  in  the  highlands.    In  upper-class  Fijian  
      households it  is now customary to  serve  soup in white half-shells of immature coconut  (not the dark,  
      mature  shells  used  for  kava  cups).    Soup  is  said  to  be  drunk  gunu,  gunuva,  not  eaten  kana,  kania .   
      Like taro leaf, meat, tea,  soup is  considered  as  a garnish  (na kena  icoi)  for “true” food  (kakana dina)   
      such as taro or yam root crops.   
suwai  n .  work-clothes.  Syn. suai.   
suwe    (or)  sue  (Ba,  Nadi)    n.    house.  Syn.  vale.    (West)  were.    Tribe  Suelevu  settled  into  the  Nadi  area  
      from  Naviti  Island,  changing  their  tribal  name  to  Vatulevu.    Pushing  aside  the  indigenous  settlers,  
      they  assumed  a  new  title  they  called  the  Tui  Nadi.  Their  earlier  origin  was  in  Vanua  Levu  via  Ba  
      according to N. L. C. Commissioner David Wilkinson.

                                                                                 T   
     The  Fijian  t  and  d  are  in  certain  words pronounced  as  a hard j  or  tch  in  Lau.   Examples  are  ititoko  =  
ij itoko  (walking  stick)  and  midimidi  =  minj i-minj i  (tiny).    Kadavu  Province  may  also  use  the j  sound.  In  
South  Sea  languages  it  is  the  vowels  that  anchor  the  meaning  of  word,  not  the  consonants,  so  these  
differences are not confusing to us.  
     In western Viti Levu the letter t usually replaces  the d of  eastern Fijian when it  is  the  first  letter of the  
word.  Thus daniva (sardine) becomes taniva in the west, and duna (eel) becomes tuna.   
    In Bua, the t is often replaced with a glottal stop which sounds a bit like a hiccup.   
  
ta-  prefix  attached  in  front  of  a  word,  indicating  a  sudden,  forceful  action, usually unintentional.   tasere   
     suddenly  let  loose,  come undone,  separated,  snapped  (rope).   taqusi   suddenly  smeared.   tasova   spilt  
     abruptly.   tamusuka  cut off  abruptly.   takoso cross over  abruptly.   takosova na  ikawakawa  cross over  
     the  bridge.    tacaqe  to  trip.  tace    torn  in  two.    tacece    to  skip  over  the  water  (like  a  high-powered  
     speedboat),  or  a  stone  thrown.  tacoka    gushing  forth,  as  a  watermain  burst.    tacuqu    to  butt  into  
     something  unintentionally.    tadola    to  burst  open,  of  a  door  in  the  wind.  tadodo    to  stretch  out  
     suddenly, as a rope under strain.  tagede  bob up and down, of a fishing-line float. (See gede)  
      In  most  cases,  this  dictionary  lists  words  according  to  their  root  (as  in  qusi,  musu,  sova,  koso)  rather  
     than  alphabetically  by  the  prefix.  The  prefix  tata  indicates  a  frequent,  repetitive  or  greater,  more  
     forceful action that the simple prefix ta.    
ta  n. two  species of unicorn fish,  edible reef fish with  a  "horn ".  Largest is Naso unicornis. N. lituratus  is  
     more brightly yellowed. They feed on seaweed, algae.    
ta  (Lau)  not.  Bauan sega. E ta lako ki Suva.  He/she did not go to Suva.   
Ta (or) Ta-ta  n .  Dad, Daddy, as said by a child. See tama-na  father.   
ta, tavaka  v. to wait for,  to meet and greet (person).   
ta,  taya,  talaka    1.  v.  to  chop,  cut  forcibly.  laki  ta  buka    go  chop  firewood.    taya  na  buka    chop  the  
     firewood.    taya  na  gaunisala    cut  the  road.    taya  na  waqa    build  the  boat  ("chop  the  canoe ").    na  ta  
     waqa   the  ship-building,  the  building  of  ships.    tatalaka  na  nona  meca    chop  down his  enemies.    na  
     veita domo  the  slitting of the throat(s).  na  itata ni buka  the chopping of firewood.  e dua na  ita  one  
     chop.      Idiom,  rather  obsolete:    Au  mai  taya  nomu  waqa.    I  ask  to  share  in  what  you  are  enjoying  
     (usually  food,  some  delicacy),  a  rather  archaic  expression, perhaps  somewhat  childish .  Helping build  
     someone ’s boat would normally call for some recompense.   
ta,  taya  2.  v.  to  gather  up  with  a  quick,  choppy  action,  as  with  sand  in  a  shovel,  or  balolo  (edible  sea  
     annelids) in a net or container.   ita nuku  shovel-full of  sand.   e dua na ita balolo  one scoop of balolo

tabace    n.  small  edible  fish  at  shore  or  reef,  light-coloured  body  with  vertical  stripes,  with  thick,  gritty  
     skin, Acanthurus triostegus.   
itaba-gauna  n.  epoch, period of time.   
itaba-gone  n.  younger generation.   tabavata   of the same generation.  
itaba-qase  n.  older generation.   
itaba-tamata  n.    generation  (of  people,  in  time).    Polynesian  chiefs  (such  as  Ratu  Sir  Kamisese  Mara)  
     have  claimed  to  recite  their  lineage  for  up  to  14  generations,  using  a  generous  imagination  to  fill  in  
     some  gap s  with  illustrious  names.  For  chiefs  of  Viti  Levu,  no  records  extend  more  than  about  8  
     generations, usually fewer. The more purely Melanesian lineages  are rarely remembered for more than  
    just a very few generations.  
taba-na  1.   n. branch  or  limb  (tree),  wing  (bird), upper  arm  (person), branch  or  “side”  (of  a  family,  as  in  
     the “woman ’s side” versus the “man ’s side” in a marriage).  vunitaba-na  shoulder (of person), branch  
     as of a government department. tabataba  shoulder-to-shoulder. vatuvatu ni taba-na  shoulder blade.     
           Traditionally, “the  side” of  a family has been referred to as na itataba, a term heard less commonly  
     today.   This  old  term presumably  gave  rise  to  “Na  ita”,  a  form  of  address between people  of  various  
     specific  territories  that  became  allied  and  bonded,  different  tribes  but  branches  of  the  same  people.  
     Fijians  today  know  with  whom  they  have  such  a  relationship  referring  to  themselves  as  being  
     veitabani with  those people; they know how to behave in that relationship, but normally  they have no  
     idea of the historical facts that created the relationship.   
          Two  kin-groups  that  are  veitabani  are  in  a  fiercely  competitive  but  friendly  relationship.  The  
     relationship  is  traditionally  said  to  be  that  the  ancestral  spirits  (vu)  of  the  two  groups  are  related  as  
     cross-cousins  veitaveleni.  This  is  the  case  with  Nakelo  and  Tokatoka  in  Tailevu  Province.  They  may  
     take  extraordinary  privileges  with  each  other,  friendly  but  forceful  insults  and  even  indecency.  In  
     effect it is somewhat like a veitauvu dredre relationship.  See tauvu.  
taba-na  2.   n.  storey  (building).   vale  taba  tolu   three-storey building.  ena  taba  rua   on  the  second  floor.

     veva.    
tabana  4.  n.    department  (of  government),  branch  (of  company).  Tabana  ni  Bula    Health  Department.   
     Syn.   Tabacakacaka.   T. ni  Vanua  Home Affairs  (Police, Prisons,  Military),  T. ni  Cakacaka   Labour  
     Department.      
tabana 5. n. section (publication). tabana ni qito  sports section (of newspaper).   
veitabani   see taba-na. This is  a type of kinship relation for a whole community, now often generalised to  
     regions. In earliest times, this was based on two  sets of people having ancestral  spirits that were cross- 
     cousin.  They  may  refer  to  each  other  as  Naita.  They  make  treat  each  other  impudently,  jokingly  
     disrespectful, similarly to the veitauvu dredre relationship.    
tabaikelekele  v.  to place hands on hips, both sides of the body.    
tabailago-taka v. inquire  informally of  a young woman ’s family,  as  to the prospects of  approaching with  
     a  formal  marriage proposal  (duguca).   vosa yalewa   ask  for  a  woman ’s hand  in  marriage.   In  modern  
     times these formal customs are often by-passed.

tabaliga (Archaic) v. to make  a thumbprint  as  a  signature, for  someone who cannot write, mostly relevant

tabaiwalu  n.  leather-back turtle with relatively soft shell having seven longitudinal ridges, and thus eight  
     plates of carapace,  as implied in the name.  It does not breed in Fiji  and is not often seen. Dermochelys  
     coriacea. Syn. tuvonu.   
vakataba  ni  uto      1.  v.,  n.    Idiom:    have  an  casual  affair,  lover.  The  implication  is  that  the  branch  of  
     breadfruit breaks easily; the relationship may not endure.   
vakataba ni uto  2.  Idiom: to be ineffective, unable to contribute  and thus useless.  A person who has no  
     adequate  presentation-goods  to  offer  at  a  magiti  is  said  to  be  vakataba  ni  uto.    Such  an  expression  
     might not be known to youngsters.   
tabakau  n.  crude  matting  made  of  split  coconut  branches  with  leaves  interwoven.    These  serve  as  
     temporary flooring or temporary walls for a shed.  May refer simply to branches of the coconut palm.  
      Idiom:  dabe ena ibe qai kisi ki na tabakau.  said about one who was riding high, and was then reduced  
     to a lowered status. Lit. sit on a fine mat, and than shift to the crude matting of tabakau.

     with  a  superior  (chief, boss,  teacher),  to be  supportive.   As  a  noun,  the  word  itabetabe has  the prefix  
     “i ” attached.  
      Idiom:  tabetabe mai  bring food (especially of women, respectfully).

tabili  2. n. mortar for pounding yaqona. Present versions  are made of wood or of metal,  metal becoming  
     more  common.    The  concept  and  word  were  apparently  introduced  from  the  Solomon  Islands,  
     according to P. Geraghty. In earliest times, kava was grated on coral (at the coast) or stone such as sule  
     in the Viti Levu highlands (cule in standard Fijian). The notion of having youngsters chew kava before  
     mixing  it  was probably  introduced  from  the  central  South  Seas.  It  has  not been  a highland  custom  in  
     Viti Levu among the “real” Fij ians.  
tabisa  (Archaic)  n.  v.  ceremony  for  a  new  event, usually  concerned  with  the  arrival  of people,  a boat,  or

     ceremonially  to  the  chief,  and  modernly,  also  to  the  Church .  This  applies  primarily  to  yams,  both  
     cultivated  and wild, but  also,  in places,  to breadfruit,  and  to  some  fruits  such  as dawa. Also,  after the  
     death of a chief, locally there may be a prohibition to fish or to harvest certain foods for a time.   
tabu  4.   n.  person  with  whom  one  is  veitabui,   with  whom  one  may  not  speak.  For  example,  formerly  a

     daku.

veitabui (or) veitabuki in Fijian custom, forbidden to talk to each other, to communicate directly, or to eat  
     certain food in each other’s presence. Certain  social groups may not associate directly with each other,  
     such  as  Waimaro  people  and  the  people  of  Bau.    There  are  also  food  prohibitions:-  in  having  meals  
     together, highland people  may  not  eat pork  in  the presence  of  coastal people,  and  coastal people  may  
     not  eat  seafoods  or  coconut  products  in  the  presence  of  highlanders.  The  distinction  is  based  on  the  
     notion  that  highlanders  are  traditional  warriors  for  coastal  people  but  in  fact  their  geographical  
     locations may have  switched with time.  Supposedly, highlanders have more ready  access to wild pigs,  
     and  coastal  people  more  ready   access  to   seafood   and  coconuts.  Within  families  there   can  be  
     prohibitions  (no  contact, no  conversation) between  children  and the maternal uncle,  and  also between  
     brothers  and sisters  (as  an incest prohibition, though no such prohibition in the west).  Keirau veitabui  
     kei Seru.  Seru  and I are tabu  in relation to each other.(and I might therefore refer to him  as my tabu.)

     not normally address his own father.

     months.  This  is  done  ceremonially  after  the  death  of  a  chief  or  generally,  to  save up  stock s  of  fish  or

     or wearing immodest dress.  Immodest dress is  a missionary notion. In earlier times, men  should wear  
     nothing above the waist unless they had chiefly status. Women ’s dress barely covered the loins.  
tabua  n. whaletooth, from the  lower j aw of  sperm whales which have  about 50  such teeth ,  about  an inch  
     apart  embedded  into  a  massive j awbone  in  a  straight  line;  all  but  about  ten  of  them  seven  or  eight  
     inches  in  length,  suitable  for  Fij ian  ceremonial  use.  Tabua  are  the  most  valuable  of  ceremonial  
     presentation goods for Fijians.  Such goods  are referred  to  as  kamunaga,  a Fijian version of wealth.  In  
     ceremonial  presentations  ten  tabua  were  counted  as  one  vulo,  as  a  form  of  counting  the  wealth  
     presented.  Previously,  tabua  in  Viti  Levu  were  reportedly  carved  of  wood,  specifically  of  bua,  in  the  
     approximate  shape  of  a plantain.  No  such  ancient  artefact has been  collected  other  than  wooden  ones  
     in  fairly  modern  times,  substituted  for  the  genuine  article,  to  be  placed  in  chiefly  graves.  Stories  tell  
     that the wooden tabua was polished,  and coloured with  sap from the fruit of candlewood tree  (lauci or  
     sikeci).  Also formerly used  as  tabua on the  coastal islands  was  a poisonous  species of  cone  shell, up  
     to nine inches in length, Conus marmoreus,  known in Bau  as  cava but  as  sauwaqa in Vanua Levu.  It  
     is  impossible  to  know  much   at  all  of  these  previous  customs.  Tongan  themselves  never  used  
     whaleteeth  in  any  ceremonial  function;  they  traded  them  in  Fiji  for  sandalwood,  used  to  scent  their  
     coconut  oil.  Tongans  and  commercial  whalers  introduced  whaleteeth  to  Fiji,  probably  in  the  1700s  
     after whaling  ship s  arrived in the  South  Seas hunting whales for whale oil to  fuel lamps  in the United  
     States  and Europe. That  industry peaked  around  1846 when there  were 900 whaling  ships  active, four  
     out five from  the  U.S.A . In  1853  some  8,000 whales were killed for oil but by the  end of that decade  
     the industry declined sharply, when whale oil began to be supplanted by kerosene for fueling lamps, an  
     innovation from  the United  States. Whalers introduced  a few huge walrus teeth which were used with  
     the  same purpose  as  sperm  whale  teeth.  Some  Tongans  learned  whaling  from  American  whalers,  and  
     have  done  hand-harpooning  of  whales  themselves  from  small  boats  for  the  meat  sold  at  Nukualofa  
     wharf  until  almost  mid-century  1900s.  Fij ians  have  never  caught  whales.  Some  whales  have  been  
     beached by themselves  and Fij ians have taken  teeth that  are to be found in the upper j aw. Most whale  
     teeth have been obtained from whalers.  Modernly  there  is  a considerable  shortage  and extremely high  
     price on whaleteeth. It is  forbidden to  take them out of  the country but there  are no  effective  controls  
     to prevent  that.  The best  teeth  are  oiled  and polished, protected by  wrapping, becoming  an  attractive  
     yellow-brown in colour that is prized  and referred to as  tabua damu.  Colouring has been effected with  
     the root of masawe, or of turmeric, or of the fruit of the candlenut tree. Tabua are normally attached at  
     both  ends  to  a  cord  of  plaited  sinnet.    Presentation  is  always  done  with  fairly  elaborate  ceremony,  
     holding  the  cord  away  from  the  tooth,  and  kneeling  before  the  recipient.  Acceptance  calls  for  more  
     ceremonial  speech. The present-day  scarcity of whaleteeth  and extremely high cost  causes diminished  
     use  in  Fijian  ceremonies.  They  are  normally  sold  through  pawn  shops  at  prices  exceeding  F$500  in  
     2009. A large tooth can cost twice that price.   
tabua  damu  n.  whaletooth  that  is highly  valued  for being  smoked  to  a  deep  tan  colour  (damu),  a  former  
     practice of Tongans in Fiji.   Smoke is from  smouldering fire of native  sugarcane or of  sweet  tubers of  
     the  indigenous  masawe  (=  vasili  =  qau,  Cordylene  terminalis).   To preserve  the  colour,  the  tooth  was  
     oiled  with  coconut  oil  and kept  away  from  the  sun,  wrapped  in barkcloth .  Tabua  may be boiled  with  
     roots  of  kura  Morinda  citrifolia,  Rubiaceae,  to  give  the  desired  rich  tan  colour.  Turmeric  (cago  or  
     rerega or reregwa), was also used for its yellowish colour.

tacaqe  v. to stumble, stub the toe, to trip on something. caqe, caqeta  to kick.

Taciqu    n.  affectionate  way  of  addressing  a  somewhat  younger person  of  the  same  gender,  ("My  young  
     brother”  if  the  speaker  is  a  man,  “My  younger  sister "  if  the  speaker  is  a  woman).    na  veitacini    the  
     group  of  two  or  more  siblings  of  the  same  sex.   Modernly,  and  more  vulgarly,  one hears  young  men

     of  the  sinnet  cord.  An  early  form  of  kava  bowl  was  a  clay  bowl  (sedre)  with  no  legs,  though  the  
     concept  of  pottery  was  an  introduction  of  Tongan  settlers.  (The  earliest,  Proto-Polynesian  settlers  
     made pottery but those pre-millenium Lapita people had no significant, continued existence in Fiji.) In  
     some  places  a  wooden  bowl  (dari)  with  legs  was  used.  In  the  highlands  of  Viti  Levu  a  bowl  was  
     improvised  with  leaves  in  a  depression  dug  in  the  ground.    The  wooden  tanoa  was  introduced  via  
     Tonga  only  in  the  latter  half  of  the  1700s.    Informally,  these  days,  Fijians  may  use  a  simply  enamel  
     basin  though  still  a  few  ceremonial  words  and  gestures  are  made  before  serving.    It  is  a  rather  firm  
     custom  that  when  a  “mix”  is  made  in  the  tanoa,  it  must be  all  consumed  at  that  sitting.   The  tanoa  is  
     not washed ;  a prized patina forms on the  surface  after long use.  The bowl  should be hung  against the  
     wall when not in use, so that dust does not settle on it. Most tanoa are made at Kabara Island, centre of  
     wood-carving in Fiji. Wood-working machinery is now used.

tauvica    in  a  question,  how  many  people?    Also  applies  to  fruit,  asking  how  many.   Na  kavika,  tauvica  
     qori?  How many kavika fruit are there there (where you are)?  Syn. le vica ? (how many people?).  
tauvimate  n., adj .  sick.  tautauvimate  sickly. Syn. (Lau, Kadavu)  baca.   
tauvu    n.,  adj .    people  of  certain  geographically  separated  tribes  who  in  legend  derive  from  the  same  
     ancestral  spirit  (vu),  or  have  been  united  anciently  by  chiefly  marriage.  One  says  that  the  people  are  
     veitauvu  (related  in  this  way).  One  may  address  one’s  tauvu  as  “Tau”.    They  are  inclined  to  make  
    jokes, play tricks  against each other, playful insults,  sometimes obnoxious. For relationships where the  
     tricks  can  be  extreme,  they  are  tauvu  dredre,  “hard”  tauvu.    Similar  mutual  behaviour  occurs  in  the  
     veitabani relationship . These days this relationship may extend to whole Territories or even Provinces  
     rather  than  specific  localities  or  specific  tribes  that  was  the  older  tradition.  Nayau  Island  in  Lau  and  
     Noco  Territory  in  Rewa  are  veitauvu,  based  on  an  ancient  marriage  of  a  Lauan  lady  into  Noco.    See  
     Tau.  taba-na.  veitabani.  
tauyavu, tauyavutaka  v. to establish, to found, to lay the foundation for. yavu  foundation, basis.   
tava,  tava   v.  to  slice,  cut  off  or  cut  into  with  a knife  (formerly  this  was  often  a  sharp  strip  of bamboo).   
     May refer  to cutting open  a mature boil,  castrating  animals  (not traditional), removing  skin of cassava  
     or  kawai  yam.  Applied  to  a  child,  this  means  to  punish  by  making  about  three  slices  in  the  flesh,  
     usually on the upper  arm.   tavatava   slicing, which may imply child punishment or bleeding for Fij ian  
     medical purposes. See tavatava.   
tava-cicila    having  many  tiny  holes,  as  a  mosquito  screen  does,  or  a  sponge.  This  is  very  probably  a  
     modernism.  
tavaka  1. v. to wait for (people). Tavaki au.  Wait for me.   Syn. waraka.   
tavaka  2. v. to “possess” in the sense that a devil possesses a person.   
tavaka  3. v.  to yank, as in  Tavaka na wa ni siwa!  Jerk the fishing line !  Yank it ! This to ensure the fish  
     is well hooked after it has bitten the bait.   
tavako    (Eng.)  n.  cigarette,  tobacco.    kana  tavako  (or)  vakatavako    to  smoke  (tobacco).    Sa  tabu  na  
     vakatavako  Smoking is prohibited.  tavako ni  Viti  is grown in Fij i, wrapped tightly in coils the size of  
     a  soccer  ball,  and  sold  in  the  market;  it  is  a  very  strong,  dark  tobacco  that  elderly  Fijians  use  to  roll  
     their  own  smokes.  Covers  (suluka),  as  for  home-made  cigars,  are  usually  dried  leaves  of  plantain  or  
     pandanus smoothed (wadruca) between the fingers.  
      Idiom:  itibi tavako (or) itibi  a “butt”, literally a “roll”, slang for a cigarette.  
tavale-na  n.  cross-cousin, ie., child of one’s  father’s  sister or of one’s mother’s brother.  veitavaleni   adj .  
     related  as  cross-cousins,  or  as  n.,  the  set  of  two  or  more  cross-cousins.  This  is  an  extremely  close  
     relationship,  very  supportive  and  essentially  members  of  the  same  family.   Those  of  opposite  sex  are  
     favoured  candidates  to  marry  each  other  in  Fiji  though  first-cousin  marriages  are  prohibited  among  
     Europeans.    Tavale  are usually  addressed  as  “tavale ”, rather  than  tavalequ.  These  days  one ’s  tavale  
     may be of the  same or opposite  sex. More traditionally, two tavale  would both be male cross-cousins,  
     and in English be referred to as “cousin-brother”.  Cross-cousins of different sex would be veidavoleni.   
     davola-na  is  the “correct”  term.  When both  cross-cousins  are  female  the relationship is  vei-dauveni,  
     and they may refer to  each other  as Dauve.  When two  separate kin-groups have gods  (kalou)  that  are  
     veitavaleni,  those  two  groups  are  said  to  be  vetabani  and  they  may  address  each  other  as Naita .    In  
     effect,  this  is  similar  to  a  veitauvu  relationship,  a  close  familiarity  that  allows  hard  joking,  harder  
     perhap s than that of two groups that are veitauvu.  See tauvu.    
tavali  v. to pass before, or go  across, one’s field of vision.  vuki  tavali  to go back  and forth  across one’s  
     field of vision.  Au a raici  koya ni  tavali ena noqu matanivale.  I  saw him/her go past  the front of my  
     house.  
tavasa  n.  unexpected  sound,  not  always  immediately  identified,  usually  a  rustling,  cracking  or  crackling  
     (twigs broken by a person walking, plastic being shuffled about, or being folded).  Au rogoca e dua na  
     tavasa    etuba.    I  hear  a  strange  noise  outside.    Sa  tavasa  na  veikau.    There ’s  a  strange  sound  in  the  
     bush.    
tavatava   1. n., v. to punish  a child by  slicing parallel,  superficial  cuts on the back or  arm. The  scars may  
     remain for life. See tava  slice.    
tavatava  2.  n,  v.   as  a  native  medical remedy,  to  apply  a  series  of usually  small  cuts  to  a painful part  of  
     the  body  such  as  the  back,  arm,  or  leg,  to  bleed  it  with  the  notion  that  will  cure  the  pain.    A  heated  
     glass,  sometimes  filled  with  smoke  is  then  applied  over  the  wounds  to  draw  out  the blood,  or  over  a  
     boil to draw out the pus.    
tava-tukituki (ni uto) v ., n.  rapid beating (of the heart), usually at some excitement.    
tavaya  n. bottle.  qa  ni  tavaya   chip  or piece  of broken  glass,  formerly used  for  cutting,  and  for  shaving.   
     Glass  was  introduced  by  Europeans.  tavaya  bia    bottle  of  beer.    Gourds  (vago),  Lagenaria  siceraria

     (formerly  L.  vulgaris),  aboriginally  introduced  vine,  now  naturalised,  the  fruit ’s  wooden  pericarp  
     formerly used as bottles for water or coconut oil, only at lower elevation areas of Polynesian influence.   
     Botanist  Seemann  noticed  they  were  in  widespread use  in  the  1860s.  Glass  and plastic replace  them.   
     Anciently  in  the  Viti  Levu  highlands,  the  only  liquid  containers  were  segments  of  bamboo.  Coastal  
     people sometimes used shells of mature coconuts or clay pots.   
tava-yaya  adj . unsettled, confused, uncertain, anxious.   
itavi  n.  task, duty, function.  
vakaitavi  v. to participate,  serve, be occupied with or  assigned to  some task , involved. era sa vakaitavi  e  
     na  soli  itukutuku   they  are  involved  in  the  release  of  the report.   na  nodra  laki  vakaitavi  ena yadrava  
     na  veisaututaki    their  (many)  going  to  serve  in  guarding  for  the  pacification  (as  for  the  United

tavilaka  v.  in forming clay pots, to whack to the outside with a paddle (itata) with a stone held inside the  
     pot.  
taviraka  v.  to  sweep,  sweep  out  (usually  house).  This  is  normally  a  vigorous  work,  using  a  traditional  
     broom  called  a  sasa,  made  of  the  mid-rib  of  coconut  leaflets.  Fijian  women  usually  prefer  this  to  
     European-style brooms. Formerly, highlanders had no sasa; they used branches of the makita tree that  
     retain their leaves.  
tavidi  v . to proceed very quietly, with hardly any noise.   
      Idiom:  e  tavidi na vusi  proceed quietly,  as  a  cat  moves.   E  tavidi na  vusi na nodra cakacaka.  They  
     went about their work quietly  
tavioka    (Eng.  tapioca)    n .    cassava,  manioc,  Manihot  esculenta.  Originally  from  tropical  America,  
     introduced  by  Europeans,  it  is  now  the  most  frequently  eaten  starchy  root-crop.  A  reddish-skinned  
     variety  called New Hebrides is commonly exported. For  ceremonial food presentations, cassava is not  
     a prestigious root-crop like the traditional yam or  taro.  Eager  for quick yields, Fij ians  sometimes talk  
     of  a  variety  called  Vula  tolu,  that  matures  three  months  after planting,  as  suggested by  the  name.  No  
     such  variety  exists.  Seven  months  is  minimum  time  to  maturity.    Sokobale  is  a  very  slow  maturing  
     variety and need not be harvested promptly.  
itavitaviraki    n.    broom.    sasa    usual  Fijian  broom  of  coconut-leaf  midrib s.    Syn.    (Lau)    tauf ale,    itaf i,   
     both types with wooden handles. Syn. itataviraki. See taviraka, above.  
tavivi  v.  entangled, as in E tavivi na me.  The goat is entangled (in its tether).    
tavo,  tavoca    v.  to  beach  a  boat  or  to  launch  it  into  the  water.    By  extension  modernly  it  can  mean  to  
     launch  some  new  proj ect.  a  public  programme,  a  new  product.  tavo  ki  wai    to  launch  a  boat  in  the  
     water. tavo ki vanua to beach a boat.  itavotavo  place at the shore for beaching a boat.  
tavo, tavoraka  v.  work too hard, sweat for it, to over-work or over-use something.  
tavo,  tavoya,  tavoitaka   v.  to  wipe  the  face,  especially  when  wet  or  damp.   me  tavoi  na  matamu     wipe  
     your face dry.  tavoya na wai ni matamu   wipe away your tears.   
itavoi    n.  handkerchief  (an  introduced  concept),  or  small  cotton  towel,  mostly  used  for  wiping  the  face.   
     sulu  tavoi    cloth  used  to  dry  a  person  after  bathing.    Presumably,  in  lowlands,  barkcloth  (masi)  was  
     used as towelling before cotton cloth was introduced.   
tavola  n.  Fiji  almond,  edible  nut,  like  an  almond,  from  a  common  coastal  tree,  Terminalia  catappa,  
     Combretaceae.  It has  conspicuouly horizontal branches  with  lvs  spirally  arranged  at  tip s  of branches,  
     very large colourful red, leathery falling deciduously  around the shore. Fls  small, white, on racemes to  
     30 cm. The nut is difficult to crack. It is eaten mostly by children, or as  a casual, occasional  snack, not  
     normally  sold  in  the  markets.    The  nuts  (along  with  coconuts  and  fish)  once  helped  this  author  stay  
     alive  when  castaway  on  an  atoll  called  Cakau  ni  Sici  (lit.  “Trochus  Reef”  but  called  Bird  Island  in  
     English).  Geraghty  speculates  that  the  name  tavola  is borrowed  from  a  Solomon  island  language;  the  
     earlier Proto-Polynesian name was  talice  (Fij ian dalice).   Syn.  (Nadro,  Serua)   tivi or j ivi.   tivi  is  also  
     the  common  name  for  closely  related  coastal  species  T .  litoralis  but  having  smaller  lvs  and  smaller  
     fruits than the edible T. catappa. Well known is timber tree T. capitanea, called tivi or tavola ni veikau  
     that  has  winged  fruits.  The  several  other  Terminalia  spp.  have  limited  forest  distribution.  Syn.  (Lau)   
     tatavola.  
tavu  (Eng.)  n. tub. tavu ni sili  bathtub.    
tavu,  tavuna    v.  to  grill,  roast  on  embers.    This  was  formerly  the  commonest  way  of  cooking  in  the  
     highlands of Vit Levu, where there were no clay pots  (kuro),  and the earth-oven  (lovo) was unknown.   

                                                                262

     See  tavuteke   to fry,  a relatively modern term, formerly unknown in Fiji. No  cooking in oil or  fat was  
     used  by  Fijians.    Idiom :    tavu  vudi.    wishful  thinking,  as  might  be  exclaimed  by  one  boy  to  another  
     who is looking wistfully at a desirable girl. The expression is heard mostly in that context.   
tavude  v. rise to the surface after sinking. See vude.   
tavukadiridiri adj .  spotted, speckled finely, freckled, mildew(ed).   
tavuki  v.  overturn. The name of  a few villages, memorialising the overthrow of  an early chiefly lineage,  
     a common occurence.  
tavulaka  v.  to throw forcefully, as a stone, or in boxing, a hard punch.   
tavulaki  knocked down, dropped  (a person dropped by  a blow,  a heavy parcel dropped hard, or  a  a boat  
     knocked over  (as  in  a  storm). By  ext., veitavulaki  ena rakavi  knocked down  (defeated)  at rugby  (of  a  
     team).  tavutavulaki  more forceful knock-down.    
tavuleni    (Eng.)  n.  tarpaulin.  Today  these  are  commonly  made  of  cheap  blue  plastic  rather  than  canvas.  
     Several spellings.  
tavuloni  v. to cover or wrap something with a piece of cloth or barkcloth.  Me tavuloni na wai ena dua na  
     tiki ni isulu.  Cover the medicine with a piece of cloth.   
tavusasa    n.,  v.  to  make  decorative  marks  burned  onto  a  person ’s  body,  shoulder,  chest,  or  the  back,  
     burning the central vein of  a palm leaf  (sasa) pricked into the  skin. These  are often  short parallel lines  
     with no special meaning, done to a child for punishment, or an adult as decoration.  Syn. tuboko.   
ta-vusoya  v.  to relate (a story) gushingly.  vuso  froth , foam.  
tavuteke  v. to fry , a method of cooking previously unkown to Fijians.   itavuteke  n. frying pan.  In towns,  
     lard is widely used because it is cheap. Popularity of frying is partly due to the speed of preparing fried  
     foods, and the shortage of firewood, a severe problem in suburb s.   
tavutoka n.  Threespot Reef Crab that has three dark spots on its shell at back. Syn. kavika.   
tavu-tonotono   spotted.  This  applies  to  a rash  on  the human  skin,  fungal  spots  on  a plant  leaf,  spotted  or  
     speckled design on a shirt, blouse or dress, or an animal. See tono.  
tavuto  (or)  tovuto  n.  whale.   Though  this  term has been  mostly understood  to  mean  the  Sperm  whale,  it  
     generally  applies  to  both  the  major  species.  Seen  most  often  is  the  Humpback  whale  (Megaptera  
     nadosa) that migrates from Antarctic, past New Zealand, to Fiji  and then Tonga in June, July, August,  
     for  breeding,  the  mother  often  swimming  beside  her  baby,  both  returning  then  to  the  Antarctic.  The  
     Humpback  is harmless,  quite  friendly  and unafraid  of humans  or boats.  It  is possible  to  make  eye-to- 
     eye  contact.  The  carniverous,  dangerous,  predatory  Sperm  whale,  Pyseter  catadon,  is  source  of  all  
     Fijian whaleteeth  (tabua), used  as ceremonial gift  kamunaga of great value.  Fij ian obtained the  teeth  
     only  by  trade,  or  from  the  lower j aw  of  the  occasional  dead  whales  found  on  the  shores.  (The  upper  
    j aw  is virtually  toothless.) This Fijian use of whale  teeth is not much older  than  a couple of  centuries,  
     an  innovation  from  Tonga   after   1750,   around  the  time  of  the  earliest   arrival  of  the  whalers.  
     Interestingly,  Tongans  themselves  never  used  the  whale  tooth  in  any  ceremonial  function  and  never  
     used  any  other  such  symbolic,  ceremonial  gift.  Previously ,  mainland  Fijians used  wooden  tabua,  and  
     the  small  islanders  (Lauans)  used  a  poisonous  cone-shell  (cava).    Only  stories  remain  of  wooden  
     tabua. There is not even a good description of what they looked like.   
          A  major  whaling  industry  flourished  in  Fiji  waters  from  the  1700s  to  mid  1800s,  with  a peak  from  
     1840s  to  the  mid  1850s,  when  there  were  more  than  700  whaling  ships  based  out  of  northeastern  
     U.S.A. By the  early  1850s  some  8,000 whales were killed for oil  each year. By  1859, kerosene began  
     to replace  whale  oil  for  lighting  lamps.  Ambergris  (“grey  amber”)  was  not  named  or used by  Fijians,  
     though  it  has  been  used  since  ancient  times  in  Malaysia  and  China  for  spicing  wine.  Its  use  in  the  
     European  perfume  industry  is  as  a  fixative,  to  prolong  the  fragrance,  and  a  couple  of  the  essential  
     ingredients  add  their  own  perfume.  The  fine,  sweet  fragrance  is  obtained  only  after  the  very  smelly,  
     greasy, lump s of grey raw  ambergris have been dissolved in cold ethyl alcohol. Ambergris is rare, with  
     quantities up  to  200 pounds  found  in  the head  of just  a  very  few  Sperm  whales, but  smaller  amounts  
     may  be  found  floating  at  sea,  or  at  the  seaside  strand.  Fij ans  have  been  unaware  of  ambergris  and  
     never made use of it.  
      Uniquely  there  was  a  Tribe  Ra  Tavuto,  as  one  of  the  five  or  perhaps  eight  social  groups  of  the  
     Butoni(vanua)  fishermen  who  live  on  the  flatlands  of  Bau  Islands  before  the  incursion  of  super-tribe  
     Kubuna  around  1760,  an  incursion  that  soon  after,  displaced  the  Butoni,  as  well  as  the  Korolevu  
     (Levuka)  sailors  and  fishermen  who  lived  on  the  hill.  The  Butoni  then  settled  mainly  in  LomaiViti,  
     especially  on  Koro  Island  but  also  elsewhere.  On  Bau  Island  the  Butoni  had  constructed  the  council  
     house called Naulunivuaka, with a separate door for each of their tribes.

     stay alert to the arrival of the worm. The rising usually occurs twice a year, October (balolo lailai) and

     discard  the piece  of  old planting  stock  that remains;  it  can be used,  making  a  much  weaker beverage.  
     Traditionally,  in  farming,  Fij ians  planted  only  from  corms,  sprouted  seedlings,  and  suckers.  They  
     never deliberately planted  seeds  except for  a few fruit trees. Their  only gardening tools were  a club to  
     knock down bush for clearing by burning,  and  also  a digging  stick  (doko) that is  still commonly used.   
     iteitei  food garden . Fijians planted some ornamentals but never had ornamental gardens.

tei   1.  verbal  modifier  adding  the  meaning  of  “first  of  all”,  "just",  "just  now",  or  "for just  now".   Offered  
     more food one might  say sa tei rauta mada, that's enough for now thanks, or Au tei kua mada  I won't  
     (take more) just now, thanks.  Ni sa  tei moce  toka mada   Good-bye for now.  More elaborately, Ni sa  
     tei toka saka tale mada.  Tou tei kana mada, qai lako.  Let’s (several) eat first, then go.   
      Idiom: Sega ni ura me sa tei damu.  Where there is  smoke there is fire.  There must be  a cause for that  
     to happen,  and the cause  is yet  to be known.   lit. no prawn just  turns red  (unless  someone has cooked  
     it)  – there is a reason for it turning red.    
tei  2.  planted.  See tea, to plant.  dau tei dovu  n . sugar-cane farmer.   
itei 3. n.   segment of  a plant that is planted  to propagate it,  such  as  a  section of yam  tuber, or  a  section of  
    yaqona stem that would include a node.

teivovo  n., v.   a  specific, brief challenge enacted out  and chanted by the Fiji national football team before  
     a major match. Though now “traditional”,  the custom dates only from the late1930s.  The custom was  
     inspired by an abbreviated version of “haka” war-dance performed by N.Z. All Black rugby team.  The  
     Fijian  version  was  composed  by  a  Vusaradave  chief  at  the  request  of  the  Vunivalu  of  Bau,  Ratu  
     George Cakobau.   teivovoi is probably  an abbrev. of  tei voavoa, with voavoa referring to  a field that is  
     abandoned  after use  as  a garden.  (In early days, Fij ian gardeners rotated the  land, not the crops.  Some  
     still do that.)  tei refers  to  something being planted or  struck  into the ground. Here the  implication is  a  
     war-fence.   
teke, tekea  v.  to kick backwards,  as  a horse does. By ext. refers to the “kick” of  a handgun or rifle when  
     fired.  Idiom:  tekea na vokete  (Anglicism) to kick the bucket, to die. Interesting that Fijians have this  
     as a backward kick, rather than a forward kick, as assumed by most Europeans.

itekiteki n.  flower or other decoration stuck in hair, usually behind the ear, by women or men.  A sprig of  
     fragrant  uci  is  commonly used.  This is often  a matter of whim rather than  any  special occasion.  One  
     hears  that  a  flower behind both  ears  means  you  are  married,  a  flower behing  the  right  ear  you have  a  
     romantic partner,  and behind the left ear, you  are looking. This was invented  as tourist talk,  and is not  
     traditional. The usually red, ornamental hibiscus  (senitoa) is introduced, not  a  traditional  tekiteki.  It is  
     contrary to custom that a itekiteki be worn casually in a chiefly village area.   
teki,  tekia,  tekilaka   v.  to  stick  a pole, post  or  stake,  cricket  wickets,  into  the  ground.   tekiteki-vaka    to

itekivu  n.  beginning. na itekitekivu  the very beginning.   
tekivu, tekivuna  v.  to begin, to begin it.    
      Idiom:    Tekivu  e  Jerusalemi    (Biblical)  Lit.,  Begin  at  Jerusalem,  i.e.,  begin  by  making  changes  at  
     home,  oneself  before  trying  to  change  others.    By  a  curious  twist  this  can  imply  doing  favours  for  
     one’s  own people before  anyone  else,  implying  that  nepotism  is justified.  Helping  one’s relatives  is  a  
     firm custom in Fiji.   
tekivu-taka  v. to start it.   
Vakatekivu  n.  Genesis.

     feral  cats, but  still reasonably common on  some other Fiji islands  and very  common in New Zealand.

     Some  live  in  social  groups  and  may  include  two  or  three  males,  each  mating  with  each  female.  The  
     males help  in  incubation  and  feeding  of  the  young.  Partly  nocturnal  and  not  at  all restricted  to  wet  or

     as  kalou  spirits.  Spirits  that  came  to be  called  the  tevoro  in  Christian  times  often possess people  and  
     they  may be  exorcised by  the  victim being  made  to believe he  or  she  is  "eating"  them.   Some people  
     are believed to have a tevoro do evil for them, by serving the  tevoro, and pouring yaqona to honour it.  
     If they cease to so honour the tevoro, they themselves may fall victim to it. This usually means seizure,

     (tiny)  bananas.      The  plaintain  vudi  is  an  aboriginal  introduction,  as  is  the  soaqa,  the  upright  banana  
     Musa  fehi.    The  introduced  “China”  banana  was  brought  to  Fiji  by  Rev.  George  Pritchard  in  1848,  
     from  Samoa  by  way  of  Tonga;  the  botanical  classification  was  Musa  Chinensis  at  the  time.  That  
     particular  cultivar  was  hardly  six  feet  tall,  and  thus  resistant  to  wind  damage  according  to  Seemann.  
     Other  varieties,  introduced  later, have been known  as  Cavendish  and  Sitivenu  (“Stephen”).    Bananas  
     have  been  grown  mostly  in  the  eastern  Viti  Levu  highlands  and  floated  in  bamboo  rafts  down  the  
     Rewa  River.  The  commercial  export  industry  was  formidable  in  its  day  but  came  to  an  abrupt  end  
     when  quality  control  was  abandoned  by  Fijian  growers  after  Fiji ’s  independence  from  colonial  
     government in  1974.     
tiale   (E. Polyn. “tiare”) n.  gardenia, the national flower of Tahiti.  Fiji has  some ten  species of the genus

Tikina  4.  n.  administrative  District  of  Fiji.  na  Tikina  o  Noco    the  District  of  Noco.  To  some  extent  
     Districts  are  designed  to  encompass  traditional  territories  (vanua)  but  that  goal  is  far  from  being  
     achieved.  The  numbers  of  Districts  and  their  boundaries  have  varied  greatly  through  Fiji’s  modern  
     history .  At  various  times  the  administrative  title  Buli  has  been  used  for  District  administrators.    In  
     1948  the  Districts,  called  “Old  Districts”  (Tikina  Makawa)  were  combined  into  larger  groups  called  
     United  Districts  (Tikina  Cokovatai).  In   1987  the  old  system  was  restored.  The  old  Districts  of  
     highlanders  of  Viti  Levu,  Colo  East,  Colo  West,  Colo  North,  were  abolished  and  merged  with  other  
     Districts to suppress the feisty, independent spirit of the highlanders, the kaiColo.

     made of a reed  (gasau), the blunt head  (ulutoa) usually of a very hard wood. The j avelin skimmed  and  
     skittered  to  its  final  stopping  place  which  was  then  marked  by  a  reed  stuck  in  the  ground.    The  
     objective  was  distance,  not  accuracy  of  aim.    There  still  remain  remnants  of  old  playing  grounds  
     marked  with  stones.  itiqatiqa    playing  ground  for  veitiqa.  tiqa,  tiqava    to  throw  the  itiqa.    Most

     Lakeba  on  the  occasion  of  the  birthday  of  Ratu  Sir  Kamisese  Mara.  Traditionally,  women  were  
     attracted to the champion.   
tiri, tirima  v. to drip, as with a leaky roof or faulty faucet.  Syn. turu.   
tiri  (or)  tiriwai  n.  red  mangrove,  with  red  sap  and  creamy  wood,  Rhizophora  mangle  (=  R.  samoensis),

     fish,  and home for crabs.  Many drooping prop roots, long thin fruit,  and flower calyx with four lobes.  
     The  stronger roots  were  formerly used  to  make bows used  in  war  (not  fishing  or hunting) by  coastal  
     people.  tiri  means  to drip,  as of water  (wai). The bark  is rich in tannin, formerly boiled  and then used

tiro,  tirova  v.  to  look  into  a  mirror  (iloilo)  or  water,  more  traditionally,  at  a  reflection, usually  checking  
     one’s own appearance. na titiro  n.  the looking at a reflected image on the water or in a mirror.  This is

     dakaititi to make the distinction. The  arrow is sici.  Bow  and  arrow were used only in war  (by men or  
     women), never as a chiefly sport, as in Tonga, and never in fishing.   
titi    v.  to  ooze,  squish  out  slowly,  to  seep  out,  as  pus  from  a  sore,  resin  from  tree-bark,  saliva  from  the

tivoli    n.  wild  or  semi-cultivated  variety  of  yam,  Dioscorea  nummularia,  a  common  source  of  food  
     available long after the regular yam harvest (February to March).   An aboriginal introduction, as were  
     virtually  all  the  yam  species.  Smooth  round  stem,  spiny  near  the  base,  not  angled  like  the  cultivated  
     uvi, but like the  uvi, the  stem twines to the right, clockwise. Good-size tubers grow deep  and take two  
     or  three  years  to  develop.  They  are  often  sought  by  burning  off  the  vegetation,  which  has  caused  
     depletion of the earlier forest in western Viti Levu. It has been good Fiji custom to replant  a  section or  
     leave part  in  the  ground  to  ensure  continuance  of  supply, but  these  days  that  custom  is  often  ignored.  
     Unlike taro (dalo)  and yam  (uvi), tivoli plays no part in ceremonial food presentations. It is  sometimes  
     sold  in  the  market.    tivoli  ni  Toga      a  very  large-rooted  tivoli.    Tikau  and  rauva  are  quite  distinct,  
     different  varieties  of  this  species.  They  also  are  sometimes  sold  at  the  public  market.  These  wild  
     varieties  of  yam,  and  to  a  less  extent  cultivated  taro,  were  the  staple  root-crops  of  Viti  Levu  
     highlanders. Cultivated yam (uvi) was important as food and prestigious presentations only at the coast  
     and on small islands where also, it marked the passage of the year with its annual harvest (yabaki).  
tivote   (Eng.)  n.  teapot.  Syn.  tip ote. It is  common custom to  serve tea with  sugar  and milk  already  added  
     with a considerable amount of both.

     He/she  has  watery  eyes  (emotion,  age,  sickness).      E  tovaki  wai  na  matana.   His/her  eyes  are  full  of  
     tears (but not falling much).

toa   1. n. chicken, orig.  the  aboriginally introduced jungle fowl, Gallus gallus.  A few  still  exist  in remote  
     areas. Most have now interbred with chickens introduced by Europeans.  In olden days the eggs of the  
     jungle  fowl,  very  difficult  to  find  and  were  not  commonly  eaten  by  Fijians.  Some  thought  them  
     disgusting,  like  mucus  they  would  say,  though  some  ate  snake  eggs  and  some  Polynesians  ate  turtle  
     eggs.  Male jungle  fowl have  flamboyant  colours.   They  were  sometimes  caught by  tying up  a  female  
     as  an  attractant.   Genetic  evidence  with  mitochondrial  DNA  seems  now  clearly  to  indicate  the  Proto- 
     Polynesians  brought  jungle  fowl  to  Chile  in  long-range  voyages.  (Science  News,  Vol.  207,  9  June  
     2007,  p.  356.)  They  also  brought  back  the  sweet  potato  kumala  and  retained  the  name  from  the

     Pandanus  leaves preparatory to weaving, usually using  a  sharp  shell  such  as drivi or  kuku, referred  to  
     as itoci.  The best voivoi for mats has such spines, while what is called Rotuman voivoi has none, but is  
     only used for inferior mats, or baskets. By ext., toci refers in carpentry to plane some wood.      
itoci  n .  plane   (carpenter ’s tool),  also the  sharp  shell used  in  stripping voivoi leaves of  spines, preparing  
     the leaves for weaving mats.   
todi, todia, todilaka  v.  to squeeze, usually between the thumb and forefinger, as in  squeezing  a boil that

todrou,  todrova    v.  to  lap  up  (liquid)  without  use  of  cup,  bowl,  as  a  man  or  dog  might  drink  from  a  
     stream.  This was the Fijian manner of drinking from a stream, without the use of one’s hands.  In rural  
     areas  this  is  still  the  custom.  In  the  Viti  Levu  highlands,  no  cup  of  any  form  was  ever  used  though  
     leaves  sometimes  served  as  a  temporary  substitute  to  carry  water  a  short  distance.  The  yaqona  cup  
     (coconut shell) was introduced from the coastal areas.  
toevu  n.  well (for water).  Sa to na toevu.  The well contains water.   
togiaki   (Archaic).  n.   Early  large  twin-hulled  Proto-Polynesian  sailing  canoe  with  a huge  deck, used  for  
     ocean  voyages  between  Fiji,  Tonga  and  Samoa.  The  outrigger  side  lay  to  starboard.  It  could  not  
     reverse  direction  of  the  sail  and  had  very  poor  ability  to  sail  to  windward.    This  brought  Tongans  to  
     Fiji with the  southeast tradewind, but made Fiji  to Tonga travel very difficult. It was displaced during  
     the late  1700s by Tongan development of the drua or kalia ocean-going outrigger  canoes which could  
     beat  to  windward  by  interchanging  of  bow  and  stern.  While  the  boat-building  skill  was  Tongan  and  
     most particularly Samoan, the timber was more available in Fij i, where the boats were made. The sail- 
     plan was probably inspired from Micronesian concepts according to Fergus Clunie.  
togoraka  v.  to  force.  Tongans  were  considered   a  forceful  people  and  the  word  Tonga  was  often  
     transformed to togo as in togoraka, and in the place-name Korotogo.   
toi  n .  clitoris.  Syn. toitoi, cui, words not usually spoken.  
toka   1. now, just for now, or at that particular time (indicating a change, or temporary  situation, espec. in  
     combination  with  a  preceding  sa).    Keitou  sa  lako  toka.      We  (few,  exc.)  are  going  now.    Sa  vinaka  
     toka.   It's good now (the way it is now).  Sa moce toka mada.  good-bye for now.   
toka   2.  v.  n.  to be  (location,  condition),  location  (at  the  time),  in  the  sense  of  “staying”  for  a  while.   Sa  
     dede na noqu toka e Suva .   I have been staying in Suva a long time.   
toka  3.  v . to sit down, as on a mat, or the grass.   
toka, vakatoka  v. to proclaim, announce.  
vakatoka, vakatoka or vakatoka yaca v. to name, give a name  (to a person). This is  a ceremonial matter  
     for  people,  boats,  buildings.  Often  the  entire  set  of  two  or  three  personal  names  is  passed  on  to  a  
     younger person, including even  a title as part of the name.  The resultant relation with one ’s namesake  
     (yaca)  is  close.    In  older  Fijian  custom  the  namesake  was  hardly  ever  the  direct  parent  of  the  child.   
     Family  names  as  surnames  did  not  exist  until  recently  adopted,  following  the  European  custom.   
     Formerly,  a person might be  accorded  a new name  at  a different  stage of  life,  and even  after death . In  
     villages,  the  major  house-sites  (yavu)  all  have  formal  names.  Properly,  in  referring  to  a  family,  one  
     uses the name of their house-site, not their own name.  Place-names have been ubiquitous in every part  
     of Fij i,  though many are lost to memory .   
tokamoce  refers to leftover cooked food to be eaten the next day.  
vakatoka ua v., n. the  action of  surfing on  a wave,  a Polynesian recreation,  especially  anciently  at Vuna,  
     Taveuni.  No  ancient  surfboard  has  been  preserved.  The  custom  is  now  a  modern  sport,  mostly  
     European. Some tourists come to Fiji for that purpose.   
vaka-tokatoka  Idiom: to practice songs or meke.  
ivakatoka  n.  prop, something used to prop up another obj ect.   
tokatoka (ni gone) n. placenta.    
itokatoka   n.  extended  family  within  a  clan  (mataqali),  type  of kin-group  in  some parts  of  Fiji  and  now  
     applied throughout Fij i by the Native Lands Commission. The word implies  a place where  the  family  
     is  staying.  Where the concept exists, this is usually the “true” occupant of the land, the people entitled  
     to use the land. There was never  any concept of land ownership in the European  sense. Land was held  
     in  trust  with  usage  rights.  The  Native  Land  Commission  standardised  the  mataqali  as  a  major  
     landowning  unit  in  official  records,  as  if  the  clan  were  the  owner.  In  Lau  a  rough  equivalent  of  
     itokatoka is  the bati-ni-lovo.  In Nadroga/Navosa there  are bito or  beto  and in Ba, kete or nalewe. On

     Vanua Levu one  sometimes hears kausivi,  according to Roth. Members  are  always related by marriage  
     or  birth  and  adoption  of  individuals.  In  larger  kin-groups,  such  as  clans,  some  members  may  have  
     joined  in,  coming  from  elsewhere.  The  itokatoka  is  literally  a  family,  and  is  considered  as  such.  All  
     members  are  intimately  related  by  birth  and  marriage.  There  can  be  fifty  members  or  more  of  the  
     family. The distinction of nuclear family was formerly less emphasized than the itokatoka.

     Migrations  from  Ra  down  into  Tailevu  followed  this  ridge part  of  the  way .  On  Vanua  Levu  Island  a

     tokelau  north.    
tokalau  cevaceva    n.  southeast  (or)  southeasterly  wind,  the  prevailing  trade  wind.  This  is  a  modernism,

     from the northeast.  
Tokalau-i-loma  n. Middle East  (Lebanon, Sinai, Kuwait, etc.). Tokalau here implies  an easterly direction

     Victoria  by  Adolph  Brewster.  Residing  nearby  at  Nadarivatu  for  many  years,  he  was  one  of  the  first  
     persons known  to  climb  to  the  top.  Many people  incorrectly believe  the  name  is  Tomanivi  and  think  

                                                                272

     that  is  an  adaption  of  Adam  and  Eve.  Tomanivei  actually  means  “bubbling  and  springing  from  
     where?”  according  to  Brewster  whose  information  came  directly  from  locals.  The  mountain ’s  name  
     suggests  the  oddity  that  from  different  faces  of  the  mountain  flow  sources  to  the  major  rivers  
     Ruwailevu  (Sigatoka  River),  the  Wailevu  (Rewa  River)  and  the  Ba  River.  Located  in  Naitasiri  
     Province,  it  is    near  the  borders  of  three  other  provinces:  Nadroga/Navosa,  Ba,  and  Ra.  Nearby  are  
     villages Nasoqo and Navai.  The mountain is home to two tree species, vugayali  and vugayalo, not yet  
     confirmed  as to  scientific name, though both  are on exhibit  at Wainadoi Gardens.  Vugayalo is totemic  
     to  tribe  Nacavodo.   Vugayali  was  reported  by  Basil  Thomson  to  figure  large  in  the  legendary  
     Nakauvadra  wars  of  Degei,  the  snake-god,  and  also  in  the  origin  of  the  Vugalei  people  of  Tailevu  
     Province. They  are distinct from the well known vuga, usually  said to be Metrosideros collina, though  
     the name vuga also  applies to two species of Geissois because the name  suggests a tree with bright red  
     blossoms.

     commoners had  little  if  any  ceremony  in  taking  a  wife.  In  many  cases  taking  a  woman  for  one  night  
     meant you had just taken her as a mate. Her relatives would normally enforce that.

     Sukuna.  He himself lived  totally  separate  and independent of  any  clan or village but he believed that  
     other Fijians were not ready  for that  type of freedom that he insisted to have for himself. This  system  
     could  hardly  succeed  when  the  independent  Fij ian  remained  living  close  to  his  village,  say  as  in  
     leasing land from his own clan. Relatives  are  accustomed to impose traditional  and family obligations

     Titles  have  varied  considerably  and  some  have  changed  with  time.  In  the  west,  there  are  Momo  or

            The title Tui  (followed by  a place-name), usually gives  a form of  address  “Ratu”  to the  chief,  a  
     custom  that  originated  in  Verata  which  had  extremely  early  contact  with  Tonga.    Many  if  not  most  
     other places in Fij i have  adopted the Tui  (with place name)  and Ratu form of  address. This dates only  
     from colonial times. The widespread use of Ratu has no justification in tradition outside of Verata. The  
     word  Roko  might  precede  the  Tui,  as  in  the  RokoTui  Bau,  and  there  are  RokoTui  also  at  Cautata,

     kg,  one  to  two  meters  long,  Dermochelys  coriacea,  uncommon  in  Fiji  waters,  seen  mostly  in  open  
     ocean,  around  shore  only  if  deep  water.  Breeds  at  Australian  north  coast,  Solomons,  Papua  and  
     migrates to Indian Ocean. During five years of fishing  and diving around Fiji I have  seen it only once.  
     Prevalent  around Malaysia, Borneo,  and visits but does not breed in Fiji.  Back is leathery with  seven  
     long ridges, black  spots with white blotches, without  a  shell,  and the flippers  are huge with no  claws.  
     Eats  mostly j ellyfish.    Fast  swimmer,  to  30  mph  according  to  the  late  Rob  Wright,  authority  on  Fiji  
     fishing.    Other  sea  turtles  15  mph.    Leatherback  can  dive  to  almost  4,000  ft,  deeper  than  other  sea  
     turtles.  While  most  Fij ians  may  have  hear  the  word  tuvonu,  they  have  no  knowledge  of  it.  There  is  
     some  confusion  with  the  equally  elusive  loggerhead  turtle,  Ceretta  carette  gigas,  the  larger  of  two  
     subspecies, the one that inhabits the Pacific.  It  is much  smaller than the leatherback, weighing  115 kg  
     to  a  a  very  rare  maximum  of  450 kg  and  differs  also  in  frequenting  lagoons  and reefs.  Food  again  is  
     frequently  jellyfish ,  but  also  clam  and  mussels,  squid  and  flying  fish .  Unlike  the  leatherback  the  
     loggerhead has  a massive head  and very powerful j aws. Its carapace is reddish brown, formerly useful  
     in commerce, as has been the shell from the hawkbill turtle, now however a forbidden trade.

tuwawa  n. giant, man of giant  size.  Stories of Fijian gods  and founding  spirits often tell of giants.  Some  
     are  still  occasionally  reported  as  seen.  Today  the  term  is  used  more  figuratively,  meaning  a  very  big  
     and  powerful  man.  Formerly  also  referred  to  a  very  small,  supernatural  kind  of  being  that  inhabited  
     baka trees in Vanua Levu. They killed their victims with bow and arrow. See Capell, p. 245.

       ago,  but  is  now  quite  rare.  Missionaries  discouraged  this.    Military  service  also  required  shortened  
      hair  style.  There  are  a couple of clans  (mataqali) called  Ulucavu,  a major one  at village Nakorosule,  
       Colo East. Their  ancestral  spirit is  a white man. When he removed his hat, Fijians  considered he was  
      removing his wig.   
Ulu-ni-Vuaka (or) Naulunivuaka n. an early place name of Bau Island, referring to the fishermen by that  
      name  who  occupied  the  low  flatlands  that  were  also  known  as  Butonivanua,  and  the  people  also  as  
      the  Butoni  who  all  later  departed  Bau  for  their  own  safety.  The  name  Naulunivuaka  also  applied  to  
      their  large  tribal house  (120 ’  x  60 ’)  with  five  doors  (some  say  eight),  one  for  each  clan:  Tunidau  ni  
      Bau,  Yavusa  Ra  Tavuto,  Taurisau ,  Bale  i  Nasinu,  and  Sanisamu.  It  was  used  for  church  services  
                                                                                                                                         th 
       1854-1880,  when  the  Methodist  church  was  completed,  later  named  Ratu  Cakobau  Church.  The  5    
      Vunivalu  of  Bau,  Penaia  Kadavulevu,  (died  19 14)  removed  the  building  to  make  room  for  playing

       silver background. There is a very similar species, somehat smaller, P. stonei, Cocoa snapper, that has  
      three or four dark patches on each side, against a yellowish background.   
ulurua    n.  an  edible  parrotfish,  Chlorurus  microrhinos,  blue  back ,  then  pink  and  belly  yellowish.  Blunt

      rainwater.  Landslides are visible in the hills and mountains as red gashes in the verdure.  They can be  
      quite dangerous, burying houses suddenly and leaving great gashes, crevices in the ground.  
univesiti  (Eng.) n.  university . There are now two in Fiji.  
uqe, uqeta v.  to move  swiftly  the mid-section of one’s body, mostly as a dance movement. This is rather  
      a  specialised word. By  ext., to  stir oneself, be in motion, moved  to  action.  vaka-uqeta na yalona  to  
      motivate.

      Idiom:  moce vakaura.  Lit. to sleep like a prawn , ready to rise to instant action from apparent sleep .   
ura  buta  n.  prawns  that  are  naturally  red;  this  requires  a  very  specialised  alkaline  environment,  with  
      brackish  water,  connected  underground  with  the  tidal  effects  of  the  sea.  At  Vatulele  Island  the  best  
      known  species  is  Parhyppolyte uveae, held  sacred,  and  may respond  to  ceremonial  calls.  (They  also  
      respond  to  a  simple  stirring  of  the  water  but  that  is  not  traditional.)  The  same  species  is  known  at  
      Naweni,  Cakaudrove  Province,  and  at  a  one-hectare  limestone  island  in  the  Philippines  where  they  
      are called pulang payasan. There  are other species  at Vatulele, smaller ones, that local Fijians  assume  
      are  simply the young ones.  In Fiji the red prawns  are  serving  as  a  tourist  attraction. At Naweni  a fee  
      is  charged  for  sighting  them  and  one  is  told  of  the  prohibitions:  no  touching,  taking,  and  no  
      photographs. The ritual call: “  ‘eitou qo na marama ni  Vuna,  ‘eitou mai via  sara  ura buta. E  tuba,  e  
      tuba,  e?”  This  is  said  to recall  that people here  supported  the  Tui  Wairuku  in  aiding  the  Tui  Cakau  
      and Dewala people to defeat  the Tongan  forces of Wainiqolo.”  It  is unclear how those Fij ian words  
      reflect the military  support but  such  is oral history.  (Ifereimi Nadore,  “Na  ura buto ni Naweni ”, Nai  
      Lalakai,  14 August, 2009, p.  13.)  
urata  n.  Banded Prawnkiller, Slipper Lobster, Lysiosquille maculata.

      done by Gilbertese  and Tuvalu people,  and  cooked while  alive. Fij ians normally  spear  them  and  sell  
      them  dead  to  hotels,  resorts,  where  often  they  become  tasteless  and  rubbery .  iseru  (or)  lawe-na

ure,  urea    v.    to  shake,  as  of  a  tree  branch,  to  bring  down  fruit.    Fruit  bats  are  caught,  especially  by  
      highlanders,  shaking  a  tree  where  the bats  are resting.  The bats  fall  in  their  confusion  and  are  easily  
      picked up. Syn. kure, kurea or sakurea.    
uro  n.  solid  meat-fat  (especially  of  pork,  beef).  Many  Fijians  are  unaware  of  its  dangers  to  health.  
      Housewives  boil  down  lard  to  use  cooking  fat  because  it  is  cheaper  than  commercial  brands  of  
      vegetable  cooking  oil.  (No  such  frying  was  ever  done  in  early  Fij i.)   By  1997  it became  common  to  
      hear  uro,  called  out  as  a  call  of  enticement  to  a  sexually  attractive  person  of  the  opposite  sex.  This  
      was done in an innocent jocular manner. The expression is now rather dated.      
uru, uruca  v.  to furl  (sail)  and figuratively, may  imply  arrival  at  destination;  to  lower  (flag),  to fold up  
      (umbrella).

uso, usora  v.  to poke, usually with a  stick , usually speaking of stones in  a fire for grilling food, or  stones  
      for an earth-oven , to arrange them. usoraka refers to the stick or other instrument used for poking.   
usouso  (Lau) adj .  exacting, “difficult”, demanding.

      vaka-sau-rara-taka.  
usutu  n . theme, important issue, central point or idea.    
uti-na n.  (Archaic).  circumcised penis.  Listed in Capell,  and known to  some people, but the word  seems  
      obsolete, unknown to many people; it is more likely to be thought of as a version of vuti-na for pubic  
      hair  (though vuti-na can  apply to other  soft hair). For reasons that remain obscure, testicles  (soresore,  
      or  more  commonly,  p olo)  may  be  mentioned  unabashedly  but  the  penis  is  less  often  mentioned  
      directly.  Perhaps the more common word for circumcised penis is now qala-na.  Cf. boci n. refers to  
      an  uncircumsized  penis,  extremely  shameful  for  a  Fij ian  male  of  mature  age.  Fiji  Indians  are  not  
      normally circumcised.  Boci may be an impolite, crude way of referring to an Indian man.  
       Idiom  (Insult):    uti  riva  suggests  stupid,  inappropriate  conduct,  referring  literally  to  an  impulsive  
      penis.   
uto  n.  breadfruit,  Artocarpus  altilis,  Moraceae.    There  are  some  forty  varieties  which  now  extend  the  
      fruiting  season  much  longer  than  the  mainly  two  months  of  harvesting  in  early  times,  March  and  
      April. The tree  is native to  coastal Fiji which has had  a  large gene-pool of breadfruit.  Some varieties  
      have seeds,  some none, and in certain areas the seeds are eaten. Fiji varieties were taken  as far east  as  
      the  Marquesas  by  early  Polynesians.  Caution:  in  Ba  and  Yasawa,  uto  refers  to  papaya,  the  weleti.  
      Inner bark  of  uto  was used  for  cloth  in  coastal  areas  if  there  was  little  masi barkcloth .  (Neither  was  
      available in most of the Viti Levu highlands.)  Leaves of uto formerly used as plates. The breadfruit is  
      sacred, totemic  at Vuda, not  spoken of freely, though it is  eaten there, which is unusual for  a totemic  
      plant. At Vuda one must eat it if it is presented at a meal, and should eat the  skin as well  as any seeds.  
      There, it would never be  cut with  a knife.   Syn.  (West)  kulu. Kulu, kuru,  ‘ulu or  ‘uru  are names that  
      extend through Polynesia.  
      Idiom: vakataba ni  uto  n. or v.  someone who is  ineffectual or unreliable, dependant on others, not to  
      be  depended  upon.    Also  to  have  a  brief  love  affair  that  could  not  become  a  dependable,  lasting  
      relationship. (The branches of breadfruit tree are fragile and breakable).   
      Idiom:  drau ni uto lutu i wai.   useless (usually of a man).  
      Idiom.  vuki na uto.  sudden, unexpected change. When uto is roasted on a fire, it is turned  around in  a  
      sudden action to avoid burning.  
      Cultivars:   
       uto dina, round, dark green fruit, smooth skin, no seeds.  
       balekana, excellent taste, small round fruit.

uto-na    n.  heart.    Modernly,  the  word  is  often  used  in  direct  translation  from  English  as  in:    uto  kavoro   
      broken heart.  Traditionally Fij ians never thought of the heart in relation to emotions.

utu 3.  n .  path that pigs travel in the bush. These can be recognised, distinct from paths used by humans.   
uvi    n.  cultivated  yam,  Dioscorea  alata,  a  most  noble  starch-food  for  ceremonial  food  presentations  in  
       coastal areas. This is a  strictly seasonal,  annual crop planted in June or July, harvested when the vines  
       die back,  around March, the earliest ones in February. The only  starch  food that  can be  stored  above  
       ground  for  many  months  without  fermentation.  (Cassava  can be kept  in  the  ground  for  a  time.)  This  
      has  been  mainly  a  food  of  the  coastal  areas  and  smaller  islands  and  its  harvest  (yabaki)  marked  the  
      end  of  the  year,  though  years  were  never  counted.  Highlanders  of  Viti  Levu,  certainly  in  the  eastern  
       sector  (Colo  Isiti),  have  no  great  tradition  for  cultivation  of  yams  though  in  modern  times  that  is  
      becoming  more  common.  They  much  more  often  ate  the  wild  species  of  yam,  and  taro  that  they  
       cultivated  and grows much more quickly. Popular early yam varieties  are vurai balavu and vurai dra.  
      Late  maturing  varieties  are  uvi  ni  Futuna,  Kivi,  Taniela  vulaleka.  Planting  of  yams  requires  more  
       specialised  knowledge  than  most  other  crop s.    The  top  section  (na  uluna)  of  the  yam  is  cut  off  for  
      planting.  In  a well matured yam, that  can be quite thin,  and it  is often dried out by being placed on  a  
      bed  of  ashes  before  planting.  The  bottom  part  of  the  yam  (dromuna)  is  cut  off  where  it  is  soft,  
       sometimes only one cm. section, when the yam is at the right stage, and that part will be for food. The  
      middle section of the yam (na kobena) supplies planting material (na vacina) that is cut off in vertical  
       sections  to  include  a  good  layer  of  outer  skin  and  those pieces  may have  a  notch  cut  to  indicate  the  
      bottom  side  that  will  be  planted  down.    Vacina  can  be  no  thicker  than  an  inch  or  so.  The  inside  
       chunks of kobena will be  eaten.  Some farmers have  the notion that  a little  salt on the planted mound  
       (buke)  may  help  the  growth .  Some  sprinkle  a  handful  of  sand  so  that  theft  of  the  planting  material  
      will  be  revealed  if  the  sand  is  disturbed  (and  the  sand  itself  is  thought  to  have  salt).  Theft  can  be  a  
       common problem since the planted vacina is perfectly edible. A hand can easily dip into soft earth of  
      the planted mound.  Without the disturbed sand, the farmer might wait in vain for his harvest from the  
      empty mound.   
uvu,  uvuca  v.  to    blow  out  air  or  tobacco  smoke  from  the  mouth  or  nose.  me  uvu  na  sici!    Blow  the  
      whistle !  (Whistles  were  known  anciently  in  Colo  West,  now  displayed  in  the  Museum,  though  
      purpose  or  function  is  not  known).  uvuca  na  biukila    to  blow  the  bugle.    na  dau  uvu  biukila    the  
      bugler.   uvu bitu  vakatagi   (Archaic) to play the nose-flute.  uvu davui  blow  the Triton trumpet-shell  
      horn.  That horn is blown at the death of Polynesian chiefs, but  also regularly, by fishermen returning  
      with  fish  to  sell.  Formerly,  in  coastal  areas,  priests  blew  that  Triton  shell  horn  in  celebration  of  the  
      yabaki annual harvest year.    
uvu-na  n.  newly sprouting leaf of coconut or plantain, not yet opened.  
uvuuvu  wai    n.  A  word  unfamiliar  to  most  Fijians.    Harmless,  and  even  quite  friendly,  the  humpback  
      migrates  from  the  Antarctic  past  New  Zealand,  through  Fijian  waters,  then  to  Tonga,  June  through  
      August, in breeding  season, before returning to the Antarctic  after  the birth of their young in tropical  
      waters.    Fij ians  have  seen  it  in  coastal  waters.  It  is  capable  of  spectacular  leaps  out  of  the  sea,  
      presumably  associated  with  giving birth  to  the  young  that  may   be  a  third  the  length  of  the  mother.  
      Most  Fijians  tend  to use  the  word  tavuto,  referring  to  any kind  of  whale.  Though  few have  seen  the  
       carniverous  sperm  whale,  all know  this  as  the  source  of  the  whaleteeth used  as  symbolic  wealth  for  
       ceremonial gifts.  There is no regularly used word for the pilot whales or blackfish , the much  smaller  
      whales that school in these waters but are usually seen only by sailors at sea.   
uwea  n.  spindle-shaped fish trap usually made of mangrove roots, by the sea.

                                                                  V   
     Where Polynesian influence is considerable, the v of Fijian is often pronounced and spelled as a p or an  
f. Thus vuaka, pig, may be heard as p uaka. Fijian vale house, is f ale in Tongan.  
     Our  list here  omits  in  most  cases  those  many  words  with  the prefix  vaka  (or  its  abbreviated  form  va),  
indicating  an  action,  a  verbal  or  adverbial  form,  or  a  similarity.  Those  words  that  begin  with  the  prefix  
vaka  are  listed  under  their  root-meaning.    Thus  vakatotolo    adv.,  meaning  fast,  and  vakatotolotaka,  
meaning hurry it up, are listed under totolo adj , fast.    
     Also,  the  many  words  beginning  with  vei,  indicating  plurality,  or  reciprocity,  are  in  most  cases  listed  
under  their  root-word.    Thus  veitalanoa,  to  yarn  together,  is  listed  under  talanoa.   Some  words  combine  
both prefixes, as veivaka.  Still, in this dictionary, the word would appear under its root, not the prefixes.   
     Similarly, names of plants  are often preceded by vu ni as a prefix, such as vunidakua for the dakua tree,  
or  vuniboro  for  the  boro  shrub.   Names  of plants  are  listed under  the root-word.   Fruits  and  nuts  are  also  
mostly  named by  adding  a prefix  vua  in  front  of  the root  word  for  the plant.   vuanikau    fruit.    vuaniivi   
nuts of the Polynesian Chestnut. In this dictionary they would be found under the root word, not the prefix.   
  
va  four.  ikava   fourth ;  vasagavulu   forty; e va na drau  four hundred; vakava   four times.  Syn. (Tonga)   
     f a.   
va-  prefix, shorter version of the prefix vaka .  va oqo  like this. va oqo-taka   do it like this.   
vacea n. a large forest tree, usable as timber, bark boiled for medicine especially for colds and for a feeling  
      of  weakness,  Neonauclea  forsteri,  Rubiaceae,  native  from  Solomons  through  to  Society  Islands.  Syn.  
     bo, vutoro.    
vaci, vacia  v . to cut pieces of yam-root especially for planting.  na vacivaci  the cutting of yams for pieces  
     to plant.

      waggling eyebrows.  deguvacu   to indicate  agreement by raising both eyebrows  slightly, usually with  
      an expressionless face.  Syn. becuru.  
vada  1.  n.   age-group.  Kua  ni  dau  veimaliwai  kei  ira  e  sega  ni  nomu  vada.   Don ’t  mix  with people  who  
      are not of your age-group.    
vada  2.  n.  (Archaic)  concubine  and  maidservant  of  chief,  a  term  only  very  rarely  used  today  but  
     understood by many Fij ians. Can refer to an unmarried woman.   
vadi, vadiga  v. to pick with the fingers,  as in picking  a guitar or ukelele, or to check something like food,  
     by squeezing it between the fingers.  Me vadigi na qita.  Play the guitar.  vadivadi  strumming (as of  a  
      guitar).   
ivadi  n. clever, ingenious act, usually ivadi ca  devious act, trickery   
vadra    n.    Pandanus  pyriformis  (or  P.  odoratissimus  or  P.  verus)  that  grows  in  damp,  coastal  places,  
     usually  in  poor  soil.  Fruit  is  edible,  eaten  mostly  by  Micronesians,  who  have  varieties  best  suited  to  
     that.  A  flour  can  be  made  from  the  fruit,  cooked  as  a  mash.  Edible  nut  inside  very  hard  shell.  
      Colourful ripe fruit used in floral garlands. Leaves used for weaving coarse mats. Dried leaves used  as  
     tobacco wrap  (suluka).  Syn. balawa. Historical  significance in the famous “first landing” immigration  
      of  Lutunasobasoba  at  Vuda,  their  first  sighting  of  mainland  occupation  was  smoke  arising  from  an  
      area  called  Vadravadra,  land  of  the  original,  indigenous  kaiNadi,  Melanesian  people,  earlier  settlers  
     here.  Later,  some  of  Lutu ’s  people  settled  in  what  is  now  Ra  Province,  at  the  mountain  range  
     Nakauvadra,  again named for the pandanus. Legend relates that  after death a man wishing to reach the  
     next world would have to throw  a whaletooth  and hit  a Pandanus tree. The  legend cannot precede the  
      1700s, with the introduction from Tonga of whaleteeth as  a prestigious symbol.  na sei  the flowers of  
      vadra.   
ivadreti  (Eng.)  n. bandage.  vadretitaka  to bandage (it). na vavadreti  the bandaging.

     nestle in the sand, almost invisible, and if stepped on, disturbed, or caught on a line, may be dangerous  
     with the whipping tail  and their  spike.  (A very large one  almost killed this  author. It had been  caught  
     on a shark line from a dory .) That tail was used formerly to shape wood because of its granuated skin,  
     said  to be  varovaroa.   The bony  tail-spike  (irabo)  can be  a  lethal  weapon.   sua  vai   to  catch  stingray  
     by spearing, a speciality of Nautodua people of Kaba, Tailevu, where this is a food specialty. Catching

     Fiji.  na  valataki ni bula galala  the fighting  for  freedom  (which is  a modernism, of  course.)  valataki

      Idiom:    na  valataki  vanua    fighting  for  the  country,  representing  the  nation  (usually  in  team  sports  
     these days).

     term for European.   
valata  (Lau)  v.  to do it, make it. Syn.  cakava.  
ivalavala    n.  conduct,  behaviour,  used  today  often  in  a  negative  sense.    ivalavala  ca    bad  behaviour,  
     usually  referring  to   some   specific  behaviour.   ivalavala  kaukauwa    forceful  behavious,  violent  
     behavious.   
vale  n. house.  vale vakaViti  Fijian thatched house. It is incorrect to refer to a Fijian house as a bure.  vale  
     kau    wooden  house.    vale  vatu    (or)  vale  simede    cement-block  house.    vale  tabatolu    three-storey

     na veivaka-valetaki  the housing.   Size of traditional houses  is indicated by the number of  fathoms of  
     length, e.g., e dua na vale katu rua  a house two-fathoms in length. The traditional Fij ian measure katu  
     is  approx.  one  fathom  (six  feet),  the  span  of  a  person ’s  outstretched  arms.      In  principal,  a  man  
     provided a house for his wife, or one for each wife, where she would raise their children.  Normally, in  
     early  days,  the  man  did  not  regularly  sleep  in  the house  of  a  wife.  A high  chief  would have his  own  
     house.  In  the highlands,  men  all  slept  in  a  large  bure,  a  men ’s house.  The  women  and  children  slept  
     quite separately.   
      Idiom:  vale katu dua  burial grave, lit. house six-feet in length.    
      Idiom: mate vale dua, bula vale rua.  literally, You might die if you eat  at only one house but you can  
     live  if  there  are  two  houses  where  you  can  get  food.    The  implication  is  that  you  should  feel  
     comfortable eating meals or staying at a relative ’s or friend’s house. Often said in good humour to one  
     who  has  declined  a  meal.    Fact  is,  it  is  a  social  strength  in  Fiji  that  a  person  who  does  not  feel  well  
     treated  in  one  house  of  the  extended  family,  may  usually  move  in  with  an  aunt  or  uncle  or  cousin  
     where there is a more welcoming attitude.   
      Idiom:  vale  drauna    fruit  of  the  ivi  tree,  Polynesian  chestnut,  an  edible  starch-food  (this  preciosity  
     derives from the fact that the fruit grows almost hidden in a small bower of leaves).  
vale lailai  n., v. toilet,  to  defecate (polite term).  
valeni (or) voleni  (Eng. fall in !) v., n.  military :  fall in !, also used  as  a noun for a parade formation. Often

     library  composed  of  the  libraries  of  Sir  Alport  Barker,  Harold  Gatty  (including  books  of  Dr.  Ronald  
     Gatty), and James Borron Snr.   
vale  ni  veivesu    (Anglicism)  n .  prison.  Korovou  is  the  holding  prison  in  Suva  as  a  convenience  to  the  
     courts.  (It  is  named  after  the  earliest  but  temporary  prison  of  Fij i,  after  Gordon ’s  Little  War.)    At  
     Naboro valley,  17 km west of Suva, is the largest prison of Fij i with some 400 acres of land.  
vale ni vo  n.  lavatory , out-house.  The concept is introduced. Fijians formerly went into the bushes or to  
     the  beach  and  used  leaves  or  reeds  gasau  as  toilet  paper.  Syn.  vale  lailai,  vale  ni   p o.   Especially  in  
     mainland  Fij i,  human  excrement  was  normally  concealed  to  avoid  witchcraft  so  no  one  identifiable  
     place was used as a toilet.  valenivo dre  n. flush toilet.  valenivo keli  n. pit toilet.   
Vale ni Yaya Makawa n. Fiji National Museum,  located in  Suva.  The Museum benefitted from the early

ivani  n. comb.  This is  a “true” Melanesian Fij ian word, common in some regions  as in Burebesaga.. The  
     more  usual  word  today  is  iseru,  a  word  of  Polynesian  origin .    vani,  vania    v.  to  comb.    Syn.  seru,

     Wailevu.  The  concept  of    a  large  Territory  (Vanua)  under  a  paramount  chief  is  an  introduced  
     Polynesian notion, first established in Fiji  at Verata  and perhaps Laucala  and later, by the immigration  
     of Lutunasobasoba  and his people  at Vuda. This imposed hierarchical  system enabled indirect rule by  
     the  British  and  continues  now under  the  Republic.  The  concept  is  Tongan  and  British  and  not  Fij ian  
     but  it  is  convenient  for  purposes  of  national  administration.    M inisita  ni  Vanua    Minister  for  Home  
     Affairs.

     others  if  the  person  has  such  things  in  abundance  and  is  not  carefully  on  guard,  or  is  not  under  the

     his wife.   
ivaqa    n.  food  supplies  for  a  voyage,  “viaticum”  (in  Latin  terminology,  as  used  in  English).  Christian

vasu  1.  (Modernism)  n.  a  person  from  outside  a  village  who  has  married  a  person  of  the  village  in  
     question. In this modern sense, it usually refers to the person of outside origin who does not live in the  
     village,  but  may  include  the  spouse  if  the  outsider  is  a  man.    Today  such  an  outsider  is  expected  
     periodically  to  contribute  money  and  goods  for  village  purposes.    Formerly,  a  couple  almost  always  
     settled in the village of the man.    
vasu  2. n. Traditionally, in the mother’s village of origin, it is the  offspring who  are  called vasu  and they

     (momo), who might be  addressed  as momo or mudrau  (abbrev. of  kemudrau   a polite  form of “you”.)   
     Formerly,  chiefs  had  extraordinary  vasu  powers  to  make  demands.  This  custom  of  making  such  
     demands is falling into disuse To have his children recognized and accepted in their mother's village, a  
     husband must bring goods (kerosene, food, mats) and whales' teeth for a ceremony called kau na mata  
     ni  gone  ("bringing  the  children's  face”).    Today  the  tendency  is  to  bring  several  siblings  at  the  same  
     time, often waiting for years till some of them  are virtual  adults.  The children must not be seen at the  
     village until the ceremony is performed.  Na cauravou oqo e vasu ki Bau.  This youth ’s mother is from  
     Bau  island.  E  vasu  ivei  o  iko ?    To  what place  are  you  vasu?     i.e.,  What  village  does  your  mother  
     come from?  
vasu,  vasuta  v.  to  ask  for  (something),  as  in  the  kerekere  custom,  where  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  be

Vata-ni-Tawake (Archaic) n. alternatively Navatanitawake, name of house-site (yavu) for a large building  
     on  Bau  Island  of  early  fame,  reconstructed  several  times.  After  being  successful  in  the  Nakauvadra  
     War,  Vueti  held  the  privilege  of  flying  his  personal  banner  (tawake)  on  the  upper  yard-arm  of  his  
     ship(s).  Name  of  this building  means  "Shelves  for  Drying  Out  the  Flags".  This  was  the  temple  (Bure  
     kalou) of Ratu Mai Bulu, god of the Roko Tui Bau. Vueti, first Roko Tui Bau was  also named Koroi  
     Ratu  Mai  Bulu,  as  a human  manifestation  of  this  ancestral  god.  Vueti  was  also referred  to  as  Ko  Mai  
     Vatanitawake.  After the Tui Kaba became dominant,  after over-throwing the Roko Tui Bau Raiwalui,  
     the temple was  also used to  serve the Kaba god of war, Cagawalu. The Vatanitawake was destroyed in  
     1837 when Tanoa was being restored as Vunivalu. Tanoa replaced the building. Cakobau was installed  
     at  the  Vatanitawake  on  26  July  1853,  and  for  the  occasion  18  bodies  were  presented.  It  was  again  
     destroyed by fire in that  same year. Calvert published  an illustration of the temple drawn in the  1850s.  
     In  1879 it became  the Bau Council House.  In  1968 Legislative Council voted  funds to refurbish Bau,  
     and specifically to rebuild a council house on this site. Lauan carpenters were brought from Namuka to  
     do the job. Bodies were found buried in the two-tiered mound, or base. Local legend relates that these

     and the Bauan dissidents.

     people  who  were  essentially  pre-Stone  Age  in  culture.  Such  fishing  in  the  highlands  was  mostly  for

     centre.  In  farming,  this  small  tree  is  sometimes  used  as  living  fence  or  as  a  windbreak.    There  is  a  
     short  variety,  vau  leka,  that  grows  to  only  about  5  m.  and  has  darker  green,  lobed  leaves.  The  taller  
     var., to  10 m. height, is called vau balavu.  Upper leaves of the  short var. are applied externally,  shiny  
     side down  against the  skin, to  alleviate  sprains  and  swelling of  arms or legs. Leaves  are often used  as

     settlements.  It  is  quite  possible  that  some  variant  of  cotton  was  an  aboriginal  introduction  from  
     America brought back by early Polynesians.  It extends right up into the highlands of Viti Levu.  The  
     cotton  is  used  by  coastal  Fij ians  (not  Melanesian  highlanders)  for  stuffing  soft  pillows  (lokoloko),  
     which  is  an  introduced  Polynesian  concept,  not known  to  early  Fij i  Melanesians.  The  chewed  leaves  
     are  applied  medicinally  to  wounds  and  sores.    Vauvau  ni  valagi  is  the  term  often  used  for  the  
     commercial   cotton   varieties,   Gossypium   arboreum,   a   13-chromosome   species   from   Asia,   was

     war clubs. The wood does not float.  It is one of the  useful plants with symbolic significance for some  
     tribes  especially  of  eastern  Fiji.  Many  Tongans  came  to  eastern  Fiji  to  build  boats  with  this  timber.  
     They introduced  the  arts of building ocean-going vessels. The tree  grows  at beach  and coastal  forests  
     below 450 m. Fls white or yellow turning purple, to 2 cm diam., one  showy petal, falling easily. Pods  
     flat 20x5 cm, 3-7 seeds, orange, mealy inside.  
      Idiom:    Sa  ciri  saka  na  vesi!    Good  night !  said  only  to  a  paramount  chief  of  eastern  Fiji.  The  
     implication is that of the chief’s canoe, made of  vesi timber, would be drifing off from shore.  
vesi  wai  n.  seashore  timber  tree,  Milleta pinnata,  Fabaceae  (formerly  Pongamia pinnata,   Papilionaceae),

     lower ones,  the lower classes of people.   
vetao or vetau n. tree, Mammea odorata, Clusiaceae,  Sap was used by Fijians to dye their hair  an orange- 
     brown    colour.  P.  Geraghty  says  that  vetau  is  an  ancient  word  for  the  related  dilo  tree,  Calophyllum  
     inophyllum.

     Island,  where  it  is  a  staple.    Though  not  a  prized  food  of  most  Fijians,  this  is  a  specialty  of  Rewa,  
     where  people  know  the  right  stage  of  harvest,  and  best  cooking  techniques  –  not  a  simple  matter.  It  
     qualifies  as  a  “true  food”  (kakana  dina),  but  is  not  considered  a  prestigious  presentation  food  for  
     ceremonial feasts. Not widely sold at the markets. Syn. via kana, via kau.    
via  mila  (or)  via  gaga  n.  Alocasia  macrorrhiza,  Araceae,  plant  with  starchy  corm,  usually  considered

     The  stems  also  can  be  edible  to  the  cognoscenti.    Leaves  have  classically  rounded  valentine  heart- 
     shape. Below the leaf-stems,  a rough “trunk” rises  above the ground.   Syn.  (Polyn. kap e or  ‘ap e.) The  
     edible, tasty, dalo ni  Toga  (Xanthosoma  sp.) with much  smaller  corms  can have  a  similar  “trunk” but  
     it is a smaller plant and its leaves are pointed.   
viavia  1.  n.  a  small  decorative  plant  in  sandy,  coastal  areas,  grown  in  lines  near  dwellings,  Crinum  
     asiaticum, Amarillidaceae.  The long leaves  are a shiny green on a stout stem, the flowers graceful  and  
     white. Shiny white sections of the leaves have been used by Europeans as trolling lures. Trolling is not  
     a native practice of early Fijians. It was mostly a specialty of Samoa.  
viavia  2.   (before  an  adjective  or  noun)   very  nearly,  almost,  tending  to be,  wanting  to be.   viavia  loaloa  
     very nearly black .  viavia turaga  acts pretentiously like a chief (though he is not).   
viavia levu  adj .  pretentious.

viciko  n.  flesh, as of meat, in contrast to fat (uro). In early times this applied only to pigs, where the flesh  
     is not usually marbled. Pork and fish were the only large mammals in the diet.   
vico  n.  several  species  of  large  grass,  especially  Erianthus  maximus.  As  a bush  food,  the  small  fruit  may  
     be  eaten  rather  like  a  tiny  duruka  fruit  (“Fijian  asparagus”).  Totemic  plant  of  some  of  the  Waimaro  
     highland  people   and  iconic  name  for  some  people  of  Dravo,  Tailevu.   Vico  leaves  have  been  
     commonly used as thatching for houses.   
vicovico  n.  navel, belly-button. Syn. (Tonga) p ito.   
vida,  vida,  vidaka    v.  to  split,  split  up,  split  apart  (wood,  coral,  piece  of  food,  marriages,  partnership s),  
     divide  up  (land  sub-division,  writing  into  sections).  Kua  ni  balata  na  ikelekele  vakaveitalia  de  kavia

     splitting up, the dividing up.   
vidavidai    split  up.    Sa  vidavidai  tu  na  vanua      the  territory  is  divided  up  (into  many  parts).  The  verb  
     wasea  would  imply  a  deliberate  division  with  a  notion  of  sharing  (though  the  shares  might  be  quite  
     unequal for some acceptable reason.)      
vidi  v.  to  spring  out  suddenly,  water  from  a  leak,  blood  from  a  wound,  an  animal  from  hiding.  Jumping  
     may be implied, and/or a sudden sound such as a clicking or ticking.  
      Idiom:  vaka  e  vidi  na  ura    conveys  the  notion  of  something  that jumps  suddenly  into  action,  as    the  
     prawn does.     
vaka-vidi-ulo  n.  feast on  the fourth night  after  a burial. The implication  is that by  this time worms  (ulo)  
     will be jumping around the buried body. (This entry is suggested by Rosiana Lagi of Moala.)

     clicking noise.  
vidividi  2.  n.  common  square  board-game  of  wood  with  counters  that  are  flicked.    A  women ’s  game,  
     traditional  precursor of this modern game, often used segments of reed that were flicked to a distance.   
     Syn. veividi.  
vidikoso  n.  (Medical)  ulcerous sore.    
“vidio”  (or)  “video”    (Eng.)  n.  video  (pronounced  just  as  in  English).    Rental  of  videotapes  has  been  
     common  among Fijians  and  a  significant  substitute for the cinema.  Videotapes  are usually referred to  
     as tep i.  DVD discs have largely replaced the tapes. Pirating has been prevalent.

vika (Eng.) n.  arithmetic, calculation.  vika kau tani  subtraction.  vika soqoni  addition.  vika vakalevutaki   
     multiplication.  vika wase  division.  vika kakavorovoro  fractions.     
viko  n.  whirlwind, whirlpool,  a word now  sometimes used figuratively. Whirlwind can destroy  a boat or  
     a  village.  Unlike  a  hurricane,  it  is  quite  specific.  In  my  experience,  a  boat  can  avoid  it  by  steering  
     away in time.  na viko ni cagilaba.  The eye of the hurricane.  
vilavila-irevo  n., v. traditional fire-walking of Beqa island. Feet of locals are impervious to heat of the hot  
     stones  said  to be recompense  for  sparing  the  life  of  a  certain  spirit  rere  that had been  caught by  their  
     ancestors.  Outsiders  may be  invited  to join  it, unharmed, but  very  few  do  so.  This  act  is  now  largely  
     paid  entertainment  for  tourists.  Science has  not  yet  determined how  it  is  that  the  firewalkers’  feet  are  
     not burned  when  they  walk  on  the  stones.  There  is  no  good  explanation  for  this phenomenon.  When  
     they  stand  still  on  the  stones  the  feet  are  protected  by  a  layer  of  green  vegetation.  These  are  special  
     stones, considered  sacred. One  speculation is that  a very thin layer of ash separates the stones from the  
     feet,  serving  as  a  kind  of  insulation.  Firewalkers  freely  invite  foreigners  to join  them,  holding  their  
     hands to prevent a fall. This author has not accepted the invitation.  
vili,  vilika  v.  to  gather,  of  certain  foods  such  as  wi  fruit,  dawa,  ivi  (Polynesian  chestnuts),  mature  
     coconuts, mango, and mussels or small clams. Mai vilivili!  Come, pick them up !  
      Idiom:    vili  wi  vakaca    to  be  beaten  by  a  large  margin  in  some  sport  or  game,  lit.  to  gather  wi  fruit  
     unsuccessfully.   
vinaka   good. vinaka vakalevu  very good.  It is  a modernism that these words have  also come to mean  a  
     simple thank you,  and thank you very much, following European custom.  In ceremonial  speech, trad.  
     Fijians do say words of praise  and appreciation but traditionally they never  said vinaka “thank you” in  
     such  a simple  and direct manner, though malo might be said by  a Lauan. Appreciation of a substantial  
     act or  a gift was,  and  still is, properly indicated by  a few  soft clap s of the cupped hands, usually done  
     from a seated position, or with a bowed back. Gifts may very often be taken for granted as if they were  
     properly due  so  that gratitude would be  superfluous. Verbal  expression of  appreciation or gratitude is  
     not  considered  necessary  for  simple  acts  of  giving.  In  some  sense,  the  ceremonial  words  a  muduo  
     would     indicate     acceptance      and    appreciation      in   very    formal     circumstances.         Syn.    (Bua,  
     VanuaLevuiloma)  re,  as in    bula re  (= Bula vinaka)  Good day ! Hello !  
vina du  (West) good, thank you.  vina du riki  thank you very much.   
vaka-vinavinaka  n.  thanking, thanks.   
vaka-vinavinaka-taka  (Anglicism) v.  to thank.  
vinika  (Eng.) n.  vinegar.    
vinakata v. to desire, wish for. Syn. gadreva.  
vinivo  (Eng. pinafore) n.   dress (as female clothing).  
viri,  viria    v.  to  tie  up,  set  up,  throw  together,  establish ,  as  of  a  fence,  bamboo  raft,  type  of  bridge- 
     crossing, or a defence.    
viri,  virika,  viritaka  v.    to  throw  (usually  a  stone)  at  person,  animal,  house.    Fijians  throw  with  great  
     accuracy  from  long  experience.  Usually,  stones  are  thrown  from  a  position  of  concealment.    Stones  
     may be  thrown  at houses  or  cars  of people  with  whom  there  is  dispute.  For  the  throwing  of  sticks  or  
     clubs, the word kolotaka applies, not virika.  virika na tamata  to throw at the person.  viritaka na vatu   
     to throw the stone.  viriviri  throwing (things, usually stones).  
viriba, viribataka  v.  to  set up fencing, as  around a garden, to keep out pigs.  Lit., throw up or tie up viri  
     a fence ba.   
      Idiom:   viribai v. to get ready for  imminent war,  setting up defenses,  specifically war fences  around  a  
     settlement.   
virikotora  v. to establish, enact, as in Lawa Virikotori  Act of Parliament.   
viritaka  v.  to throw it forcefully (stone, ball).  viritaki uma shot-put (athletics).  
      Idiom:  Sa  viritaki na kena vatu.  It is  already decisively rejected, lit.  a  stone has  already been thrown  
     at it.  Can  also mean that the decision has been made to quit  something, such as  a game.  A child may  
     spit on  a  stone and throw the stone into the bushes to indicate that he is quitting  a game. The notion is  
     that if you found the stone he would be forced to stay. Actually, nobody much would try to find it.  
viritalawalawa  n. spider. lawalawa suggests the spider’s web as netting.  
visa,  visa  v.    to  burn  hot,  of  a  fire,  cause  the  flame  to  rise,  build  up  a  fire  by  adding  wood.  Cakobau ’s  
     father  Tanoa  earned  the  name  Visawaqa  for  burning  boats  of  the  Roko  Tui  Bau  Raiwalui  at  Vuna,  
     Taveuni Island.

viti,  vitika  1.  v.  to  push  apart  (vegetation)  to  peer  ahead,  in  the  bush.  This  is  sometimes  said  to  be  the  
     origin   of   the   Fij ian   name   "Viti"   for   Fiji,   "Fij i"   being   the   English   spelling   for   the   Tongan

     over when four or five feet tall to encourage more rooting,  and longer leaves. Leaves  are cut, boiled in  
     water,  then  sun-dried.  The  thorny  leaf-edges  are  stripped  off  (toci)  with  a  shell  (kai),  or  a  knife.  
     Smoothed,  the  leaves  are  often  then  coiled  for  storage,  sale  or  transport.  Unlike  mats  made  of  sedge  
     (kuta),  voivoi  mats  can  be  washed  repeatedly  in  water.  voivoi  ni  valagi    introduced  varieties,  green  
     leaves often  striped or  streaked with yellow or white,  some with no leaf  thorns.   Voivoi may be listed  
     as  P .  caricosus,  P.  thurstoni,  P.  joskei  (all  endemic  to  Fiji),  or  P .  whitmeeanus,  which  is  the  most  
     highly  prized  species  for  weaving  mats.    P.  whitmeeanus  probably  originated  in  Vanuatu  and  was  
     introduced  aboriginally  to  Fiji.  Voivoi  was  not  formerly  grown  in  the  highlands  of  Viti  Levu,  where  
     the  only  traditional  mats  were  woven  of  sedge  (kuta),  that  did  not  require  cultivation.  Syn.  kiekie.   
     (Lau,  Kadavu)  kie.    (Nadro,  Navosa)    yaba.    Ten  voivoi  leaves  may  be  referred  to  a  one  buki.    One  
     hundred voivoi  leaves  are  spoken of  as being one buto.  Approximatel one buto of voivoi is needed to  
     make one sleeping mat  (idavodavo).   
voka  n.  low tide.  sa kui vakaukauwa na voka  the outgoing tide flows swiftly.  Sa gole na voka.  The tide  
     has turned.  Sa tekivu di sobu na mati. The tide has begun to fall.   na vokavoka  the tidal movement.   
vokai n.  Forest  Gecko, Gecko vorax  The babies hatch unattended. I  found  a baby one, five  inches  long,  
     in the  month of May on the lower branches of  a tree. Their  feet with  adhesive discs help them  climb.   
     In captivity they can be encouraged to eat by hand feeding. They accept finely cut fruit, wet leaves and  
     flowers  of  hibiscus  (se-ni-toa),  and  wet  leaves  of  the  bele  vegetable.  With  gentle  handling,  vokai  
     become accustomed to humans but their bite is very painful and they have an edgy temperament. They  
     may be  found  from  three  inches  in  length  to  12  inches.  They  can  move  with  startling  speed  to  avoid  
     danger,  or  to  catch  an  insect.  Viti  Levu highlanders  frequently  ate  them  after  grilling  (tavu)  over  fire  
     or  hot  coals,  and  some  are  eaten  still.  These  geckos  are  not  to  be  confused  with  iguanas,  known  as  
     saumure,  which  are  much  larger.  Some  mainland  Fijians  have  referred  to  iguanas  as  vokai  but  these  
     days most Fijians have never  seen a vokai.  Similarly, the iguana is  almost never  seen due to predation  
     by  the  mongoose  and  feral  cats.  A  couple  of  the  small  gecko  species  are  found  in  houses,  and  are  
     usually known as moko.

vola, vola  v.  to write.  volai  written, “written down”,  as  a Fij ian  may be written down  as  a member of  a

     of writing. Previously this version of the word  vola referred only  to markings or  an indicator or  sign,  
     as in iVolasiga, the planet Venus, morning star that indicates the coming of dawn. (Appearance of that

     different  locations;  it  signifies  the  collection  of  Fijian  goods  submitted  as  tribute  in  olden  days.

     inlaid  pearlshell  with  whaletooth,  made  by  Tongans,  some  given  by  Bau  to  compliant  lesser  chiefs  
     who cooperated with the extension of Bauan influence and  power.   
vonu  n.  giant  sea-turtle,  usually  referring  to  the  Green  Turtle.  Unlike  the  smaller  Hawkbill  turtle  (taku),  
     the Green  is docile  and usually does not defend itself by biting.   It is vegetarian, favouring  sea grass.   
     Breeding  takes  place  only  at  very  specific  sandy  locations  to  which  the  turtle  returns  after  a  long  
     absence.  Sex  ratio  of  newborn  turtles  depends  on  ambient  temperature  at  incubation  of  eggs;  higher  
     temperatures  around  30  degrees  C.  yield  females  while  lower  temperatures  yield  males.  The  name  
     vonu also refers to the much rarer Leatherback, Dermochelys coriacea,  ika dina, which is occasionally  
     seen in Fiji waters, usually  at  sea rather than right by the  shore,  for  apparently it does not breed here,  
     and  it  has  practically  never  been  caught  in  the  Fijian  traditional  turtle  nets.    In  the  Pacific,  it  has  
     breeding grounds along the coast of Mexico.  It is  a much bigger turtle, up to perhap s 8 feet in length,  
     the  male  weighing  as  much  as  two  tonnes.  The  leatherback  is  the  world's  largest  reptile.  It  is  seen  
     basking  at midday, gathering body heat.  At other times it dives very deep,  to  at  least  3  thousand feet,  
     feeding  mainly  on jellyfish  and  zooplankton,  as  they  rise  and  fall  in  a  daily  cycle.  Adults  are  more  
     commonly seen in cold waters (40° F or less), except when they are breeding.   
           The Loggerhead turtle, one of the world ’s oldest  species, is rarely  seen in Fiji waters, mostly in the  
     open ocean, lazing on the surface. Spending five years  at sea as a diver and fisherman, I have seen one  
     only once. Weighing  300 pounds or more, it has  a huge, broad head with very powerful j aws that can  
     bite  through  heavy  clamshells  that  are  almost  two  inches  thick.  It  is  carniverous  but  never  wilfully  
     attacks humans. This  tuvonu never breeds in Fiji. Its main breeding grounds are very far  away, mainly

     along beaches from Texas to North Caroline,  and also at the coast of Oman. Eggs  are laid in the  sand,  
     and covered, to hatch after about two months.    
           Turtle was  a chiefly food,  and  social groups called Gonedau existed to catch turtle with nets  (never  
     spears), for their paramount chiefs  at Verata, Bau, Cakaudrove. For the chiefs of Verata, the people of  
     Qoma  Island  were  traditional  turtle  fishermen.  Turtle  fishermen,  and  concept  of  paramount  chiefs  
     were  of  Tongan  origin.  Much  ceremony  attended  the  fishing  for  turtles.    Turtle  fishermen  were  
     sometimes  also  naval  warriors,  such  as  the  Lasakau  of  Bau.  Carving  of  the  portions  was  a  skilled  
     occupation. At Bau, the turtle was killed by poking a sasa (coconut leaf midrib) up the turtle ’s nostril.  
     The  throat  is  then  slit.  Normally,  the  turtle  heart  beats  long  after  the  turtle  is  dead,  a  disturbing  
     phenomenon for  anyone to witness. Cutting up  the  turtle was  a very  specialised occupation,  carefully  
     done,  with  the  various  parts  given  out  to  various  people.  The  blood  solidifies  by  clotting.  Put  in  a  
     bowl, water accumulates above the clotted blood, and is discarded. The clotted blood is then cut, more  
     or less in cubes, and is cooked with the meat and fat.  It is is an extremely rich food.   
            Cakaudrove  chiefs  ate  turtle  eggs,  often  raw,  sometimes  cooked.    Other  than  the  eggs,  the  Tui  
     Cakau  was  specially  given  the  fatty  part  from  inside  the  back  of  the  turtle,  a  part  called  the p ito,  
     implying  a navel  in Tongan language. The  shell  and  some  leftover parts  were reserved for the people  
     of Benau,  a  seafaring people originally from Tonga, expert divers,  fearless of  sharks. As with whales,  
     the meat is not marbled with  fat,  so  a  sauce or coconut cream  are required, or the  addition of  fat. The  
     fat congeals on cooking and turns a dark green colour, extremely rich in taste  and can be eaten only in  
     small quanitities.   
            Sanctity  of  the  turtle,  and  the  calling  of  turtles  to  the  surface  has  been  traditional  at  village  
     Nacamaki, Koro Island,  and  at village Namuana, Vunisea harbour,  Kadavu Island. Turtles  are now  an  
     endangered  species.  Their  main  enemy  is  man,  and  also  sharks.  A  large  tiger  shark  can  swallow  a

votu 2. n. vowel. This word is  a modern invention of teachers of Fijian language, unknown to the general

     vakavuna v. to cause.   
vu 3. n.  ancestral  spirit of one or more tribes  (yavusa), originally  a person who founded that  social group,  
     who  may  have  become  deified  in  a  sense.  In  some  cases  the  spirit  could  take  the  permanent  or  
     temporary  form  (waqawaqa)  of  an  animal,  or reside  in  a rock  or  tree.  That representation  (rock,  tree,  
     living creature) would be respected with avoidance or  some respectful behaviour, perhaps even gifts,  a  
     small  branch  of  leaves,  or  even  a  whaletooth  in  the  case  of  Degei.    But  for  the  vu  there  is  no  
     supplication for special favour such as success in war. Among Fijians themselves, the term kalou vu is  
     sometimes confused as a  synonym for vu. And this is a topic one may not always discuss openly. Only  
     some of the vu have names, or the names are forgotten probably because one is usually not encouraged  
     to pronounce the name. By contrast, for kalou vu, temples were built  and attended by just a few  select  
     people,  services with offerings  and  solicitations,  advanced through  a priest bete, who would take  care  
     of  food  or  any  gifts  presented  for  the  kalou  vu.    The  kalou  vu  did  not  necessarily  ever  have  any  
     previous  human  form.  An  authority  as  great  as  the  late  Solo  Bulicokocoko  referred  to  the  spirit  Tui  
     Naikasi  at village Nacamaki, Koro Island,  as a kalou vu, yet in the formal chants calling the turtle, the  
     people  themselves  refer  to  it  as  their  vu.  There  has  thus  come  to  be  some  confusion  among  Fijians  
     themselves as to usage of the terms vu and kalou vu.   
          When two kin-groups or tribes have the  same  ancestral  spirit  (vu), they  are  said to be  tauvu to  each  
     other.    For  example,  in  Fij ian,  Era  veitauvutaki  kina  na  vanua  o  Noco  kei  na  vanua  o  Lau.    In  
     English :- The Territory of Noco  (in Rewa Province) is  tauvu with the Territory of Lau.  They have  an  
     historical  intimacy,  and  may  take  liberties joking  with  each  other.  In  some  cases,  this  can  be  “hard”  
     joking  and they  are  said to be  tauvu dredre. Formerly  such relationships were often between two very  
     specific places but  in time this often becomes  a relationship between both regions. In  early times, for  
     example,  the  relationship  of  Noco  did  not  extend  to  all  of  Lau  but  only  to  Nayau  if  I  remember  
     correctly ,  and perhaps  only  to part  of  Nayau.   Such relationship s  can become  established  after  a  very  
     high level chiefly marriage between two places. Details are often forgotten .   
          The  social  relationship  called  veitabani refers  to  two  specific places  that have  ancestral  spirits  (vu)  
     that  were  cross-cousins  (tavale)  to  each  other.  They  may  address  each  other  as Naita  and  treat  each  
     other with very severe hard joking.

vu  4.  (Anglicism) n.  verb.  vuwale  intransitive verb.  This Fijian word for “verb” has been invented and  
     adopted  by  local  teachers  of  language.    The  vu  is  considered  the  root-word,  that  in  Fijian  may  be  
     followed by one or more suffixes (called  dewa, another invented word) that alter the meaning to make  
     the  verb  transitive,  and/or  add  various  prepositions.  For  instance,  cici    is  the  root  verb  “run”.  Ciciva   
     means  to  run  for,  or  run  to.   And  civivaka   is  to  “run  with”  (say,  carrying  a knive),  or  “”run  to  get”.   
     vu-vakavu  (Anglicism)  n. transitive form of  a verb, causing that verb to happen, e.g., dara is the verb  
     to wear, put on  (clothes, ring on finger). vakadarama is the vuvakavu to express the notion of causing  
     the  clothes,  for  example,  to be  worn.   Such  modern  linguistic  terms have been  invented  recently but  
     are unknown to the general public.   
vu  5. n.,v. to cough ; or  as  a  “cold”  that  implies coughing.  Sa manati au na vu.  I have  a fit of  coughing,  
     have a cold that makes me cough. vuvu  continued coughing.   
vu ni kalou  n. traditional midwife.   
vu ni koli  n.  whooping cough.  koli  dog.  
vuniduvu  n.  composer  and choreographer of meke  (traditional dance  and  songs).  He is highly respected  
     and rewarded for creating and “giving” the meke, which then belongs to the recipients who have asked  
     for it.  Syn.  dau ni vucu.   
vua  = vei koya  to him/her/it, for him/her/it.  Solia vua  .  Give it to him/her/it.  na ka e sa yaco vua  what  
     (that which) happened to him/her. mai vua  from him/her, in relation to him/her.  cakacaka tiko vua na

     cevaceva    wind  from  the  southeast  (the  tradewind),    na  ceva    the  wind  from  the  south.    vualiku   
     northwind, northeasterly, north, northeast (the proper, older meaning).   
vuaka  (Polyn.) n. pig, pork.   vuaka  tagane  boar.  vuaka balavu   (Archaic)  human cannibal meat,  a  term  
     well recognized but  now used  very rarely,  and  only  in joking.   The pig  was  introduced by  aboriginal  
     Fijians. It was more efficient and less encumbering to hunt them when needed, rather than domesticate  
     them. Only very  small pigs were kept  for  a  time  as pets by  Melanesian Fij ians.  On the larger  islands,  
     pigs  are  trapped,  or  with  the  aid  of  dogs,  hunted  with  spears,  only  as  needed  for  feasts,  not  as  an  
     everyday  food.  Several  glands  must  be  cut  from  the  boar  to  avoid  off-flavour.    At  large  ceremonial  
     food presentations,  ten pigs  are referred  to  as  one  rara.   There  might be  two  or  more  rara presented.

     nothing of the work itself.   
      Idiom:  vuaka balavu  n. cannibal meat, human body for eating.  balavu  tall (or) long.   
vualiku    n.  north  wind,  north  (as  a  direction)  or  northeast,  northeasterly ,  the  more  “correct”,  older

vuaviri    n.  overthrow  (of  a  chief,  or  regime),  military  coup  (May  and  September  1987,  2000,  2006).  
     Before  colonial  times  a  very  great  number  of  chiefly  lineages  had  been  overthrown  and  replaced  by  
     outsiders.

vude  v.  to bob up,  as  a head  emerging  from  diving.  Idiom:   n.,  v.  vude   modern  social  dance  that  in  Fij i  
     involves a lot of bobbing up and down.   
vudi    n.  plantain,  and  aboriginal  introduction  usually  eaten  as  a  cooked  starch-food,  often  as  sweetened  
     pudding, with coconut cream (only in coastal  areas). Sometimes listed  as Musa balbisiana, though this  
     genus  is  very  labile  and  difficult  to  classify.  The  original  varieties  are  now  referred  to  as  “true”  
     plantain vudi dina  to distinguish them  from  later introduced types.  vudi vula is  a  tall plant with very  
     plump fruit that often  split  as they ripen. This is not considered  a defect by Fijians.  Some  also believe  
     that the fruit of this variety  (and  also watermelon, by the way) will crack open if there is  any thunder.   
     Planting  is  by  suckers  and  the  mother  plant  naturally  sprouts  suckers.  The  leaves  are  useful  as  
     improvised  mats  or umbrellas,  and  stripped  into  sections,  formerly used  for  “skirts”  of both  men  and  
     women.   
      Idiom:   vocia  vakavudi.   something  done  very  easily,  quickly  with  no  effort,  such  as  in removing  the  
     skin of plantain fruit, to gush forth with the whole story .  
vudolo  v.,  adj .   snapped off, broken off, having a broken handle (usually spade,  axe, garden tool), vudolo  
     rua  broken in two, as a boat crashed on a reef.   Syn. ramusu or kamusu.   
vueta,  vuetaka  v.  to  raise  up,  as  with  a  fishing  net;  to  rescue.    na  tamata  vuetaki  ena  wasawasa .    the  
     people picked up at sea. vueta na lawa  to raise the net.  Me vueti na lawa.  Raise the fishing net. Vueti  
     was  the  name  of  a  chief  from  Verata,  who  won  a  major  victory  for  Degei  in  the  Nakauvadra  wars  in  
     the  mid  1700s.  Moving  south  to his  father’s home  at  Moturiki  Island, he  founded  the  tribe  Vusaratu,  
     and  adopted  the  title  Roko  Tui  Bau.  With  the  Tui  Kaba  as  his  Vunivalu,  he  formed  tribe  Kubuna  at  
     Kubuna  on  the  Tailevu  coast  and  invaded  a  small  island  he  named  Bau.  Significantly,  Vueti  is  a  
     Tongan  name  (Fueti),  as  is  the  name  of his  father,  Vaula  (Paulaho).  There  was  very  substantial  early  
     Tongan  influence  in  Moturiki.  The  Tui  Moturiki  with  an  entourage had  migrated  to  Tonga  at  least  as  
     early as the  1200s. Legend also tells of Tongan settlement on Motoriki.    
veivueti    n.    AID,    assistance  (usually  financial)  in  raising  up,  usually  speaking  of  help  to  indigenous  
     Fijians.  waqa ni veivueti   rescue boat.  Veivueti  name of  a military operation that claimed to raise the  
     status and economic well-being of the Fijians after the military coups of  1987.  
vuga  n. bush  or  tree,  Metrosideros  collina,  Myrtaceae,  with  conspicuous  red  (sometimes pink  or  yellow)  
     flowers  all  year.  Prop  roots  at  the  base  of  the  tree.  Shaggy  light  grey  bark .  Slash  is  red,  exposing  
     yellow  wood.  Legend relates  that  vuga roots  from  Nakauvadra  extend underground  to  Verata,  or  that  
     the root was taken to Verata and planted,  symbolizing the continuing blood relationship of the people.  
     The  Verata  extension  is  known  as  the  Waka  ni  vugayali  (“Root  of  the  vugayali”).    Another  legend  
     relates  that  the  root  extends  underground  to  the  west,  by  Vuda  and  village  Viseisei.    The  roots  
     reportedly have blood-red sap,  symbolic of the blood relationships descended from Lutunasobasoba,  a  
     late  immigrant  chief  who  promoted  the  new  notion  of  paramount  chiefs.  Earlier  Melanesian  settlers  
     from  Vanuatu  and  the  Solomons  had  never  known  the  concept  of  paramount  chiefs.    Vugayali    is  
     legendary  tree  of  Vugalei  people,  name  of  the  last  child  of  Degei,  but  from  shame,  Vugayali,  with  
     permission of Degei,  changed his name to Kau. According to Basil Thomson,  a bush  called vugayali  
     was  cut down by Vueti in overwhelming village Narauyabe  at  the  Nakauvadra mountain range  in Ra.  
     Narauyabe  was  the  village  of  Tongan  boat-builder  Rokola,  who  was  protecting  the  Ciri  Twins  who  
     had killed  Degei ’s pet  fowl  Turukawa.   Trees known  as  vugayali  still  exist  at  Mt.  Tomaniivei  (=  Mt.  
     Victoria,  highest  mountain  of  Fiji,  given  its  European  name  by  Adolf  Brewster.)    The  Fij ian  name  
     means “From where does it  flow”, referring to this  area  as the  source of  the Ba River,  Sigatoka River  
     and  the  Rewa  River.).  The  name  is  not  Tomaniivi,  “Adam  and  Eve”,  as  is  often  thought.  That  tree  is  
     the  totem  of  tribe  Nacavodo  at  village  Nasoqo,  Nabobuco  District,  Naitasiri  Province.  These  were  a  
     Waimaro people  now  living  at  the  border  of  Provinces  Naitasiri,  Nadroga/Navosa,  Ba,  and  Ra.  One  
     Vugalei  author  with  some  schooling,  reports  that  the  suffix  yali  comes  only  from  the  locals  deeply  
     regretting the loss of their tree that apparently had symbolic value to them. There is a  slightly different  
     species  called  vugayalo  with  flowers  more  starkly  scarlet,  and  leaves  that  are  more  tender  and  shiny,  
     and coloured  a somewhat darker, duller green.  Brewster consideres the name vugayali to be a mistake  
     for vugayalo.  In fact,  they  are  two different plants  as reported by the Forestry Department. Examples  
     of  each  are  grown  for  demonstration  at Wainadoi  Nature  Gardens.  Botanical  identification  is  not  yet  
     determined.    
vugo-na  n.   a  set  of  specific  mutual relationships  within  a  family ,  also used  as  a  form  of  address.   For  a  
     younger  person,  na  vugoqu  usually  refers  to  an  aunt,  or  an  in-law.  It  may  also  refer  to  the  mother’s  
     brother,  an uncle, but he  is  much  more  often referred  to  as  momo.  The  elder person  will  also usually  
     address  the  nephew  or  niece  as  vugoqu.  The  younger  person  will  generally  address  na  vugona  as  
     mudrau  (probably  an  abbreviation  of  kemudrau,  a  respectuful  form  of  “you”  because  it  is  in  plural

     of  people  are  naturally  immune  though  Dr.  Corney,  medical  officer  in  Fij i,  calculated  in  1907  that  
     leprosy was the cause of deaths of 0.8 percent of Fijians in his time. Symptoms  appear on skin rashes,  
     sores  on  feet,  in  deadening  of  nerves,  stuffy  or  bleeding  nose,  eyes  (glaucoma),  disfigured  limb s,  
     erectile  dysfunction,  kidney  damage.  Treatment  is  by  Multi-Drug  Therapy  over  12  months,  though  
     infectious dangers  cease  after first treatment. In  1890  a leper  settlement was  established on  138  acres  
     purchased on Beqa for Fijian patients, with non-Fij ians located  at Walu Bay next to the then Colonial  
     Hospital.  In  19 11,  Makogai  Island  was  established  as  a  leper  colony  with  20  patients  cared  for  by  
     Roman  Catholic  sisters.  It  was  closed  in  1969  with  the  remaining  17  patients  transferred  to  P.J.  
     Twomey Hospital in Tamavua.  Some 4500 lepers had been  treated  at Makogai  and  1500 were buried  
     there.  To  be  remembered  especially  was  Rev.  Mother  Mary  Agnes  who  served  on  Makogai  for  34  
     years,  dying  there  at  age  80  in  1955.    She  had  been  awarded  the  M.B.E.  and  the  Legion  of  Honour.

     of  Kadavu,  and  Noco  in  Rewa  Province.    The  suffix  sa,  in  this  context,  might  refer  to  spears  (as  
     suggested to me by the recent chief at Weilagi, Ratu Jone Radrodro), or to an  ancient particle meaning  
     “tribe”,  as in the word yavusa .  At Weilagi, the chief is  also referred to  as the Tui Taveuni but Vunisa  
     is the traditional Fijian title. The title Tui was  introduced from Tonga, via Verata, probably no earlier

     west  where  the  title  Momo  is  common  and  even  the  concept  of  yavusa  is  foreign.  Vunivalu  is  not  a  
     form  of  address  and  does  not  attach  to  the  name  of  the  chief  or  the  the  village  or  territory.   In  many  
     places the chief goes through  an installation ceremony to confirm the choice, especially if there might  
     be  any dispute,  especially when lease-money is  at  stake. Under Tongan influence via Verata  that title  
     is often displaced in favour of Tui, followed by the  location.  Many of the older, local titles now play   
     a  secondary  role  to  the  title  of  Tui  this  or  Tui  that.  Vunivalu  is  best  capitalised  when  it  refers  to  a  
     specific chief.

vutu    (or)   vutu    kana     n.  “edible”    vutu.    endemic     nut-bearing     coastal    tree,  Barringtonia      edulis,  
     Barringtoniaceae or Lecythidaceae.   Vutu kana is semi-cultivated, edible, tasty and crisp when raw but  
     sometimes boiled  or roasted,  as  a  starch-food  on  the  main  islands  where  it  thrives  in  the  wet  climate,  
     damp  ground,  and  may  be  found  at  the  Suva  market  (March)  but  fruits  and  flowers  throughout  the  
     year.  Inflorescence large,  showy, pendant, with long white stamens tinged pink. Fruits oblong to 7 cm  
     long,  ripens  to  dark  green  or  purple  green,  with  persistent  calyx,  Syn.  vala  (old  Oceanic  name,  Lau,  
     Macuata, West.,  Kadavu),  and in Melanesian English  “cut nut”.  Care must be  taken not to  confuse it  
     with a somewhat similiar looking poisonous species, vutu ni wai or vutu gaga  B. racemosa.  The fruit  
     of  a  third  species,  B.  asiatica,  vutu  raka  or  vutu  rakaraka  is  also poisonous,  formerly used  as  a  fish- 
     poison,  and  as  floats  for  fishing  nets;  these  nuts,  the  size  of  a  fist, have  four  distinctive  angles  and  a  
     pointed  tip,  easily  identified  and  very  common  around  the  shore.   The beautiful  flowers  open  only  at  
     night,  falling  to  the  ground  by  dawn.  Grated  seeds  on  the  water  serve  as  a  fish  poison  but  less  
     effectively than Derris spp.

     life  was  unknown  to  Fijians  before  the  advent  of  Europeans  (though  trans-sexuals  and  trans-vestites  
     were  known  and  tolerated).  veivutu  may  also  refer  to  heterosexual  intercourse  with  the  vulgar

     The  letter  w  is  probably  a  little  over-used  in  Fijian  writing,  where  the  letter  u  might  suffice  in  some  
cases,  or  no  letter  at  all.  Regional  variation  of  pronunciation  complicates  the  matter.    Readers  tolerate  
various  spellings  that  do  not  affect  the understanding.   The  word  for  “flood”  may  appear  as  waluvu  or  as  
ualuvu.   
  
wa  n.  string,  cord, vine. The names of vines may be written  as two words, or  as one.  wa bosucu may be  
     written  as wabosucu. Many types of vine  are known to Fij ians  and  some of them  are useful. Regional  
     names vary greatly. Common cordage has  also been made from fibres of banana  stems, and from inner  
     bark of vau shrub stems and branches as well as sinnet (magimagi) from coconut husk fibre.  
  wa bosucu n. a fast-growing vine, Mikania micrantha, Asteraceae, climbs rapidly over other plants, even  
     telephone poles,  an extremely common introduced weed. Introduced from America circa  1900. Leaves  
     useful  to  alleviate  insect  stings  and  to  heal  small  cuts.  Also  may  help  protect  yaqona  bushes  from  
     sucking  insects  that  transmit  deadly  virus.  Many  regional  synonyms.  (Rewa,  Kadavu)  wabutako.  
     (West)  ovacia or  ovaova.   
  wa  coro  n.  thin,  strong  vine,  white  sweet-smelling  flowers,  small  black  fruit.  Useful  for  binding,

     door  helped  keep  out  evil  spirits.  This  fern  grows  by  winding  around  other  plants.  Syn.  (Kadavu)  
     komidri.   
  wa  ki  n.  used  for  tying  thatch  on  roof.  In  Tailevu  Province  (Vugalei  area)  it  is  used  for  weaving  sova  
     baskets  and  modernly ,  laundry  baskets,  or  small  decorative  baskets.    One  var.  has  thin  stem,  called  
     walaki  in  the  islands.  (The  name  walaki  is  used  for  Flagellaria  indica,  very  probably  the  same.)  The  
     main var. has thick  stem. Called wa ulo in Colo East. Called vakasara in parts of Tailevu. Stem of the  
     mature vine is very  strong  and woody, like rattan . For basket-weaving, very thin  strips  are  cut in  long  
     lengths.   
  wa  kurukuru:  n.    common  running  weed  that  covers  vegetation,  used  for  tying  up  bundles.  White  
     flowers  Nov-Dec,  signal  that  mussels  (kai)  are  fully  fleshed  for  eating.  Flower  petals  drop  away,  
     leaving “wood roses” used modernly in  floral decorations. Tiny  seeds  are  airborne.  Mashed-up leaves  
     are  applied externally to infections to draw out pus. Leaves  and vines boiled with pandanus leaves for  
     black  colour.    Botanical  name  is  Morinda  myrtifolis,  Rubiaceae,  in  A.  C.  Smith,  but  Na  Ivolavosa  
     VakaViti lists it as Merremia peltata, Convulvaceae.   
  wa  me  n.  vine,  Freycinetia  storckii,  Panadanaceae, used  in house-building, basket  weaving,  long  leaves  
     like pandanus,  sweet-smelling white  flowers  attract bats. Fibre used in binding house rafters.  Growth  
     as  a  vine  climbing  trees  with  leaves  only  at  the  top  of  the  plant,  and  aerial  roots  grow  down  to  the  
     ground. Syn. (Cakaudrove)  mere.   
  walai n. Entada phaseoloides. Heavy forest rope. See walai, separately, below.     
  wa loa n.  Rhizomorpha  sp. black,  shiny, formerly used for “kilts” or “skirts” for men  and women .  Syn.  
     sausauwai. This  and divided plantain leaves made the commonest forms of dress for early Fij ians. The  
     loincloth (malo), made from barkcloth (masi) was introduced from Tonga.  
  wa lutumailagi  n. “vine fallen from the  sky”, Cassytha  filiformis,  a parasite common on the islands off  
     Nadi and the nearby mainland.  Ultimately it destroys the parent plant.   
  wa  midri  n.  tree-climbing  fern  with  edible  fronds,  Stenochlaena  palustris,  Blechnaceae.  Sturdy  vines  
     used by highlanders in bindings, as for outrigger of takia paddling canoe. (Coastal Fijians used sinnet.)  
  warusi    n.  common  climbing  liana  or  shrub,  Smilax  vitiensis,  Smilacaceae, by  current  fad  (2006/20 10)  
     widely  touted  that  an  infusion  of  the  woody  roots,  and  also  the  leaves,  serve  an  an  aid  for  erectile  
     dysfunction  for  men,  wai  vakaukauwa.   As  a placebo,  it  may  still have  some positive  effect  if people  
     believe  in it. No  tests have been made of medical  effectiveness. In  the  Suva market bottles  sold for  as  
     much  as  F$5  in  2009.  Some  claim  this  is  a  general  tonic  and  others  say  it  cures  headaches.    More  
     common, traditional use for the tough, thin  stems has been  for binding, for  fish nets,  and for  weaving  
     baskets.  Stems  usually  smooth  but  some  prickles,  leaves  with  five  veins,  perianth,  anthers,  ovaries  
     faded yellow, fruits purple or black. Flowers and fruits all year round.  Syn. (Lau) kadragi.

  wa  sara    n.    a  wild  edible  corm,  considered  a  yam,  often  eaten  raw,  especially  by  highlanders  of  Colo  
     East by my observation. This is probably the  same  as wa yaka. Nai  Vola ni Kau gives wa  sara  as the  
     Wainibuka name for wayaka, Pueraria lobata, Fabaceae. I believe the same name  applies in Colo East.  
     See wa yaka below.  
  wa  ulo    (Wainimala)  n.  Flagellaria  gigantea,  type  of  woody  vine  or  rattan  used  in  building.    Strips  of

     Hairy stem, three-leafed, flowers white tinged with purple.  Grows wild. Syn. (Colo) wa sara.

iwabale   (Archaic)  v., n. barkcloth  cummerbund covering  at least part of  a man ’s chest  and properly one  
     shoulder, part of  ancient formal chiefly costume, only in coastal  areas  and smaller islands, unknown in  
     Viti Levu highlands where there was no mulberry barkcloth in earliest times.  The higher the wrap , the  
     more prestige implicitly  asserted by the wearer. Wearing the  iwabale could be dangerous presumption,  
     virtually  a  challenge  in  ancient  times.  Modernly,  iwabale  may  refer  to  anything  worn  over  the  
     shoulder, without chiefly implications. wabale, wabaletaka v. to put on or wear the iwabale.

     has  been  the  common  way  for  clearing  the  nose  of  mucus.    In  Colo  East  the  verb  is  waru,  waruca.   
     wadruluka  to remove excess mucus from the nose by the same action of thumb and forefinger.  This is  
     still common practice  among  some people who have not yet adopted the use of handkerchiefs or toilet

     from  Tonga,  ilavo)  were  formerly  used  as  playing  pieces  in  a  game  veilavo.  The  coin-shape  of  the  
     seeds  inspired  Fijians  to  use  their  name  for  the  English  word  money.  The  leaves  of  walai  have  been  
     used medicinally by pregnant women. After cooking and washing,  and draining, the  seeds  are eaten as

     named for its row of eight small fins along the back, behind the dorsal fin. It is caught by trolling close  
     to  the reef.  The  concept  of  trolling  was  introduced by  Tongans  and  Samoans.  The  frozen  walu  steaks  
     served  by  some  restaurants  are  a  poor  version  of  a  very  tasty    fish  when  it  is  fresh.    Walu  is  often  
     preferred for making marinated raw fish  (kododa). It is very similar in appearance to the larger  (to  120  
     cm)  wahu  or  wahoo,  Acanthocybium  solanderi,  usually  a  deeper-water  fish  previously  unknown  to  
     Fijians  (who did not fish beyond the reef) but now with the name wahoo borrowed from Hawaii.  The  
     wahoo is more  elongate,  cigar-shaped with  a  sharper  snout while  the walu is deeper  and flatter with  a  
     blunter  snout.    Teeth  of  the  wahoo  lower j aw  fit  inside  the  teeth  of  the  upper j aw  while  the  teeth  of  
     walu  are  fairly  matched.  The  wahoo  generally  dies  with  the  eyes  looking back  that  is  not  the  case  of  
     the walu.  Definitive indications of  the wahoo is  a  small  tag in  the fork of the  tail,  and the number of

wa-sekaseka  (or)  wa-seisei  (Archaic)  n.  chiefly  necklace  of  finely  split  whaletooth,  now  seen  only  in

    direction  of  important  guest  or  chief.    At  the  head  of  the  tanoa  there  are  attached  two  white  cowry  
    shells  and  one  is  attached  to  the  distal  end  of  the  cord,  closer  to  the  guest(s).  This  is  symbolic  of  a  
    penis  with  two  testicles.  It  it  forbidden  for  anyone  to  walk  in  front  of  the  tanoa.    (At  informal  
    occasions, if necessary to cross in front, one would walk bowed down, and touch the bowl in passing.)  
    All  of  this  formality  and  ceremony,  and  the  tanoa  itself  are  Tongan  introductions  though  the  watabu  
    itself is a Fij ian innovation. Tongan bowls had the wooden nubbin but not the sinnet cordage.

    but not yet married. Formerly, future marriage partners were  sometimes  selected for children. If  a man  
    and  woman  are  seen  together  they  will  almost  immediately  be  thought  to  be  “married”  informally.   
    Brothers of  a young woman may become violent if  a Fij ian man courts her without  serious intentions.  
    To be formally married  (vakamau)  in Church or  civil registers is not  always  thought necessary except  
    within traditional villages. As it now occurs in many other  countries, Fijian couples may live together  
    without any formal arrangements in urban areas. They may marry later or just remain as “partners”.   
veiwatini  n. couple(s) of married people or co-habiting man and woman.    
vakawati v., adj . to take  a spouse, usually with no formal ceremony. All that is required is to live together

yabaki  n.  year.  Former  meaning  was  annual harvest  (mainly  of  yams,  which  figured  in  traditional  Fijian  
     lunar  calendars,  beginning  late  February  or  March),  the  “months”  being  separated  approximately  by  
     natural phenomena relating to gardening work or marine harvests.   See  the  end pages of  this book for  
     details  of  this  indigenous  lunar  calendar.  ena  veiyabakai      every  year.  vakayabaki    annual(ly).    O  sa  
    yabaki vica ?  How old are you? (to a child).  na cauravou yabaki 19  the  19-year old youth.  na tamata  
    yabayabaki  vata    the people  of  the  same  age.     Early  Fijians  never  counted  months  or  years  and  the  
     concept  of  “week”  did  not  exist  for  them.    They  knew  their  age  not  in  number  of  years  but  only  as  
     greater  or  less  than  others  of  the  village,  especially  their  siblings.  Or  they  might  say  they  were  born  
     before  or  after  a  certain  well known public  event.   kakana  ni yabaki   n.  seasonal  food. yabaki  balavu  
     (Anglicism) n. leap year.   yabaki ni bula n.  age  (of  a person). Fijians normally report their  age by the

     Taccaceae,  and less commonly T. maculata, more often referred to  as yabia sa in Fij i.  The root can be  
     poisonous but was eaten usually in the form of  a well washed, flour-based pudding, especially in dry,  
     sandy  areas  at  low  altitudes  where  it  grows  best.  Hardly  ever  cultivated,  yabia  grows  semi-wild  in  
     drier areas of Tailevu, other parts of Fij i but less common and even unknown in the interior, and where  
     there is high rainfall.  T. maculata is not found  at  sandy beach  areas but rather in the dry hilly country  
     below  350  meters.   The  true yabia  grows  widely  throughout  the  Pacific  from  India  across  the  eastern  
     Polynesia.  It  may have  reached  Fiji  naturally  or,  as  John  Parham  suggested, have been  introduced  to  
     Fiji  by  Polynesians  who  long  ago  favoured  arrowroot  as  a  more  important  food  than  it  ever  was  to  
     Melanesians.   
yabia    2.    (Regional)    cassava,  an  introduced  American  plant  that  has  assumed  great  importance  in  the  
     Fijian diet. Name  copied from the  arrowroot name, possibly because both can be used to make  starch.

     context.   
yabia  ni  vavalagi  n.  arrowroot,  West  Indian  Arrowroot,  Maranta  arundinaceae,  Marantaceae,  origin  in  
     Brazil  and  Central  America,  an  early  introduction  to  Fij i, but  not  common  and  not  grown  or used by  
     Fijians.   This  is  the  commercial  species  on  the  world  market, used  for  arrowroot  flour  and  arrowroot  
     biscuits.    
yabo,  yabora    (Ra)    to  kiss  (traditional  sniffing,  nose  to  side  of  nose,  or  face).  Syn.  regu,  reguca.  Such  
     Pacific  Island  sniffing  may  be  done  on  greeting  or  farewelling  friends,  relatives,  and  formerly,  to  
     farewell  a  corpse  in  a  ceremony  called  ireguregu.  These  days  for  babies  and  live  adults,  light  cheek- 
     kissing or forehead-kissing tends to replace sniffing.   
yabo, yaboca v. to pass the hand over, touching lightly, as if checking something.   
iyabo  n.  (Obsolete) man who has traditional role of handling the body of a dead chief, in only some areas

     ask permission to use it if  some other people feel that they own the name  Na yacana vakavuku n. The  
     scientific name (this of course, a modernism).  See vakatoka.   
yaca    n.  namesake.    nomu  yaca    your  namesake  (who  may  be  addressed  as  Yaca).    There  were  no  
     surnames in Fiji until  some Fij ians began to follow that European custom.  But in many cases both the  
     Christian name  and the family name might be given to  someone quite outside the  family. Formerly,  a  
     child was never given the name of its parent. Before Christian times  a person might be given different  
     names  at  different  stages  of  life  and  even  after  death.    If  someone  has  been  given  the  name  of  your  
     father  you  may  address  that person  as  Father   Tamaqu.  Also,  one’s paternal uncles  (father ’s brother)  
     are considered as one’s father.      
yaca vata  v. to bear  a  common name,  as  for example, in referring to  all races of Fij i citizens  as “Fijians”  
     or all white people as Europeans.

yaqona  n.  cultivated  shrub,  Piper  methysticum,  Piperaceae,  aboriginal  introduction  from  Vanuatu  (the  
     centre  of  its  natural  gene  pool),  used  as  a  ceremonial  and  social  beverage.    The  Polynesian  name  of  
    yaqona is kava  (or various versions of kava,  such  as  ava, or  awa.)  and kava is the usual English word,  
     more informally, grog. Speaking in high  ceremony, Fijians may refer to it as na wai ni vanua.   
          The  root  (waka)  and  above-ground rhizome  (lewena)  are pounded  or  grated  (formerly  chewed  into  
     dry balls by men, usually)  and infused in water, then  strained  and  served.  Saliva  increased its potency  
     and almost tripled the weight of the yaqona. In Lau,  as in Tonga, the skin  scrapings (karikari) or chips  
     of  skin  (civicivi) of the rhizome  are removed to make  a whiter, less bitter beverage.  Most coastal  and  
     small-island Fijians  sun-dry the  chopped-up plant-parts before use. Fiji highlanders, like the people of  
     Vanuatu, traditionally use the fresh green plant, uncured, which is a much more potent intoxicant but  a  
     much  smoother  drink  with  fewer  hangover  effects  when  used  as  the  highlanders  use  it.    Fij i  
     highlanders  make  a  much  less  condensed  mixture  to  drink  as  compared  to  the  Vanuatu people  where  
     the beverage is prepared viscous and extremely concentrated.  
           Yaqona is  a mild narcotic  and diuretic that relaxes the  muscles  and  the mind  and  allays  thirst.  (For  
     this  reason  it  was  for  Polynesians  useful  on  long  voyages  when  water  was  scarce.)  Only  excessive  
     drinking  inhibits  or  impairs  movement  such  as  walking,  making  it  uncoordinated.  Only  extreme,  
     continued consumption leads to  addiction  and results in dry,  scaly discoloured  skin  and bleary  eyes  as

well  as  disaffected  behavious.    Under  normal  consumption,  the  mind  remains  clear  and  a  pleasant  
mood  is  engendered.  Foreigners’   initial  impressions  of  the  taste   are  usually  negative.   Serving  
conditions  are not  at  all  sanitary but fortunately, yaqona is  an  antiseptic,  so the  same cup may be used  
for   serving   many   people.   The   physical   and   mental   effects   of  yaqona   are   largely   due   to   the  
concentration  and  relative  amounts  of  some  six  major  lactones.  The  kavalactone  content  depends  on  
the variety of yaqona, the location of the plantation,  and whether or not it is  sun-dried  (which reduces  
the concentration considerably).  Normal concentration of kavalactone might vary between  six percent  
and fourteen percent.  A maximum in Fij i might reach fifteen to twenty percent, which is quite rare.  
           The  plant  is  propagated  only  vegetatively  by  cuttings  of  the  stem,  and  requires  three  years,  
preferably  five  years,  before  the  whole  plant  is  harvested.  Main  cultivars  are  either  dark-skinned  
yaqona  (yaqona  loa), or  lighter-coloured  skin yaqona  (yaqona vula).  The  lighter coloured  type  takes  
longer  to mature  (at  least 5 years) but may be kept  in  a growing  state  as long  as 20 years or  more.  It  
makes  a  smoother  beverage,  though  the  types  and  different  cultivars  are  not  distinguished  in  the  
market-place,  or  in  traditional  ceremony.    Specific  varieties  include  kasa  leka,  dokobana  (and  either  
may  be  yaqona  loa  or  yaqona  vula),  qila  (green  skin,  thick  stem,  short  internodes),  yalu,  honolulu  
(bright green  stems). No distinction  as to variety is made in retail  sales,  and few if  any differences  are  
visible  in  the  sun-dried product.  In  very  formal presentations  for  a high  chief  the  whole yaqona bush  
will be presented.   
          A  cup  of  the  beverage  is  in  some  areas  traditionally  drunk  by  a  new  chief  to  signal  his  formal  
installation in office. He/she is said to be vagunuvi.  Yaqona is now a common social beverage but still,  
a  minimum  of  ceremony  attends  its  serving.    Even  the  casual  friendly  visitor  will  say  a  few  formal  
words  as  he  sets  down  his  gift.  (Sa  dua  na  taga  lala  .  .  This  is  but  an  empty  bag  .  .  .).    Sailors  and  
especially  divers  may  offer  a  libation  to  the  shark  god  Dakuwaqa, pouring  a  cup  into  the  sea, before  
they  themselves  will  drink.  That  will  protect  them  from  sharks,  as  long  as  they  have  avoided  recent  
sexual  intercourse.    Yaqona  is  served  at  virtually  all  Fijian  rites  of  passage,  birth,  marriage,  death.  It  
has been  a part of  almost  all formal or official meetings  and has been  served  in most offices, much  as  
morning tea was  part of  the British ritual. Today ,  some of the Christian denominations forbid the use  
of  yaqona  and  it  has  become  forbidden  in  government  offices.  Nonetheless,  a  gift  of  yaqona  is  an   
essential  ceremonial  when  presenting  oneself  (isevusevu  ceremony),  in  being  introduced    to  village  
elders.  
          Yaqona  is  not  supposed  to  be  drunk  by  a  person  alone,  and  once  it  is  mixed  (lose),  that  quantity  
should  be  consumed  completely.    Though  now  a  popular  drink,  yaqona  was  formerly  mainly  the  
privilege of chiefs and priests  and men  as elders of the village. Its use in formal ceremony, reinforcing  
the  social hierarchy by  the  order  of  drinking,  is  a  custom  introduced  from  Tonga,  as  is  the use  of  the  
wooden  tanoa  serving  bowl  that  was  unknown before  about  1800.    Highlanders  had  no  use  for  such  
protocol  or  severe  social  distinctions.  They  mixed  their yaqona   in  a  leaf-covered hole  in  the  ground,  
knelt down, and sucked it up, lapped it up much as a dog drinks from a puddle, this being called burau.  
This  may  still  be  done  in  rural  garden  locations,  especially  by  Viti  Levu  highlanders.  Or  more  
modernly, a cup may be fashioned from a leaf.     
          When sold in powdered form, yaqona root is normally adulterated with by at least a third of rhizome  
and  scrapings  of  the  skin.  For  this  reason,  many  Fijians  buy  the  unpounded  kava  and  pound  it  
themselves. Pounding is considered to make  a better product than grinding, possibly due to the heat of  
the grinding process.     
          A  person  may  engage  a  demon  (tevoro)  to  gain  power  over  another  person,  and  is  said  to  pour  a  
yaqona  to  his  devil.  This  is  a  Faustian  concept.  His  disadvantage  is  that  he  must  keep  up  serving  
yaqona to the demon  and misfortune will befall him if he ever  forgets.   Such practices  are believed to  
be quite current.  
          Some special words and phrases relate to yaqona:    
        na isevusevu  root presented to host by a visitor to his host as a way of formal introduction.   
        na lose yaqona  the mixing of the yaqona (or) one who mixes the yaqona.  
        na tu yaqona  the formal serving of the yaqona (or) the one who  serves the cup of yaqona to the  
chief or honoured guest.  
        rabe, rabeta  to drink the next cup following the more important person, as a supportive gesture.   
        na ibili ni mua   last round of serving, “one for the road”.  
        na  bulu  yava      round  of  yaqona  served  after  departure  of  guest,  when  last  comments  and  
memories will be discussed. Memories may then be set aside.    
        ititoko, last cup before a person quits the session of yaqona drinking, lit. a walking stick.

yaqoyaqona  n.  a  common   weed,  Macropiper  aduncum  (Piper  timothianum  and  P.  vitiense),  Piperaceae,  
     which  resembles  yaqona  in  appearance.    Its  main  use  perhap s  is  for  making  improvised  iqilai,  
     improvised pieces of  shrub branch used  as  a hook for restraining clumps of grass with one hand while  
     cutting  with  a knife  in  the  other hand,  or used  as  a hook  to pull  down  fruit-tree branches,  to pick  the  
     fruit.    Yaqoyaqona  is  said  to  be  the  form  of yaqona  used  as  a  beverage  by  the  gremlins  (veli)  of  the  
     bush.  Syn. onolulu. (West)  qonaqona.   
yara  (or)  yaro    (Eng.)    n.    harrow,  as  used  in  farming,  usually  hauled  by  a  steer,  but  some  powered  by  
     diesel engine.  siviyara  v ., n. to plough, an introduced concept.  
yara-taka v. to haul, drag behind oneself.  By  extension, modernly, language  teachers use the word yara  
     to indicate  a vowel or  syllable  that is drawn out in pronounciation, like the “o” in  the word for cloud.   
     sa yara na  “o ”. They sometimes indicate this by placing a macron above the vowel.   
      Idiom:  yara benu  ceremonial clapping when  a chief has finished his meal. Lit., haul  away the refuse.  
     (benu  garbage, refuse).   
vakayarayara  v.  to keep on delaying, deferring, to prolong.   
iyarabale    n.    dry  dock,  place  where  a  boat  can  be  hauled  out  (yara).  Formerly  referred  to  a  low-lying  
     stretch  of  land,  place  where  a  boat  might  be  hauled  across  the  land  to  reach  the  opposite  sea.  Both  
     Vanua Levu and Kadavu have such places.  
iyaragi    n.  weapon.    tagane  vakaiyaragi    armed  man.    na  biu  yaragi    the  laying  down  of  arms,  the  
     disarmament. Originally, this word referred only to indigenous weapons such as the club or spear.  
yaraneke n., v. to  cheat,  as  at playing cards,  such  as  in the card game  tarabu  (“trump”).  Such cheating is  
     commonly done, considered playful and clever. Caught, the cheater will usually laugh.  Syn. eraneke.   
yarayara  1.  here  and  there.   kacivaka yarayara yani  vei  ira     call  out here  and  there  to  them.   Me  tevu  
    yarayara  ena  veico    spread  it  out  on  the  grass.   E  dau  kele yarayara  na  motoka.    The  cars park here  
     and there (wherever they can).  moce  yarayara   to sleep in various different places.   
yarayara 2.   to  continue doing  something.   tagi yarayara   to keep on crying.  vosa yarayara   to keep on  
     talking.    talanoa yarayara  to yarn on and on.    
iyarayara  (Lau)  n.  small mat made specially for new born baby.   
yaro  n.  sp.  of  endemic  tree,  mainly  Premna  protrusa  (formerly  P.  taitensis),  Verbenaceae,  valued  for  
     durability  of  the  timber,  often used  for house-posts,  one  of  the best  timbers  for  that purpose.  Cream- 
     coloured  to  yellow  flowers,  corollas  to  9  mm  in  length,  clusters  of  small  (to  7  cm)  4-seeded  globose  
     black  fruit,  a drupe.  Yaro is  also P.  serratifolia,  a  similar  coastal  species, very resticted in distribution,  
     often  near  mangrove  areas;  its  corollas  are  much  smaller,  only  to  4  mm  in  length.  Dried  heartwood  
     may  scent body oil in the lowlands.  (There was no body oil in the highlands of Viti Levu.)  Syn.  (Lau)   
     waro.   
yasa 1. v. to move about silently, usually secretly, with ulterior purpose (theft, violence, evesdropping).   
yasa 2. n.,  adj . person who remains  away from his village. After  a long absence, returning even for  a brief  
     visit  requires  bringing  of  gift  goods:  kerosene,  cloth ,  food.  This  costly  custom  keeps  many  Fijians  
     from restoring close contact with their village when they have been long absent.   
yasa  ni   at  the  side  of.  E  dua  na  vu  ni  niu  e  tiko  ena yasa  ni  vale.   There  is  a   coconut palm beside  the  
     house.

     Province.   
yasayasa  n. region.  Yasayasa vakaRa  Western Region.    
yaseyase  n. lightning.   na lidi ni yaseyase  the lightning strike.   
yasi  n.  sandalwood,  Santalum  yasi,  Santalaceae,  endemic  in  the  central  South  Seas,  Vanuatu ,  Fiji  and  
     Tonga. Greatly valued  in the Orient, which led to  an influx of U.S. trading  ship s for only ten years in  
     the  very  early  1800s,  till  the  plant  became  almost  rare.    This  small,  2  to  12  meters,  wild  tree  is  
     becoming common again in Bua especially. Wilkes  (184 1) says its  area was restricted to fifteen square  
     miles, in barren  and rocky land. Now it is  also growing in Kadavu  and  a few trees  are exhibited  at the  
     Nature Gardens  at Wainadoi,  some 22 km west of  Suva. It is not easy to propagate because the young  
     plant requires certain fungi  and becomes  a parasite on the roots of nearby trees.  (Commercially, lemon  
     trees  are  often used.)  Fijians had  never  cultivated  it  and  they  never used  it  in body  oil before  contact  
     with  Tongans  who  used  it  traditionally,  and  Europeans  who   adapted  it  from  Oriental  custom.  
     Inconspicuous  florescence  in  the  axils  of  leaves,  tiny  white  florets  turning  pink,  then  rich  red  at  
     maturity.    Fruit  round  and  small,  1.5  cm  diam.,  green  turning  purple  to  black,  with  sweet  pulp,  seen

     mostly  around  August but  exist  throughout  the  year.  Wood  of  the  living  tree has  little  of  its  fragrant  
     scent  that  develops  when  it  is  dried.   The  tree  grows  to  more  than  twenty  feet,  with  a  trunk up  to  six  
     inches  in  diameter,  the  bark  distinctively  grey.  Quite  another,  unrelated  species  of  forest  tree  is  also  
     called yasi,  from  some  similarities.   To  distinguish  this  other  species,  the  term used  is yasi  ni  veikau   
     forest  "sandalwood", or yasiyasi. See below. This counterfeit sandalwood sometimes raises false hopes  
     for windfall money.  
yasiyasi  n.  a  forest  tree,  Syzygium  spp.,  Myrtaceae,  with  extremely  durable,  springy,  tough  hardwood,  
     formerly  used  for  house-posts  and  for  bows  (for  war)  by  highland  Fijians.    Bows  were  not  used  by  
     Fijians for  anything but war  (not for sport, not for hunting or fishing). Lowlanders were more likely to  
     use bows  made  from branches  of  mangrove  tiri.   By  contrast,  in  Tonga bows  were  only  ever used by  
     chiefs, and only in sport such as shooting at rats.   
yaso,  yasova    v.  to  howl,  to  yowl  (dog,  cat,  person).    tagiyaso    v.  to  howl  with  grief,  tears,  crying,   
     typically at funerals.  
yatayata v., n. trembling, quiver usually of voice, incoherent mumbling as of a delirious speech.   
yate-na    n.  liver.    Idiom:    yate  lailai    coward.    yate  levu    courageous.  The  liver  is  considered  to  be  the  
     principal organ of the body and the focal point of one’s courage.  (The notion of the heart connected to  
     romance or sentiment is a novel idea borrowed from Europeans.)  yate dei  firm, unyielding in  spirit.     
      Idiom:  Na  yatemu  e  vaka  na  yate  mai  lagi!    lit.  your  liver  is  like  liver  from  heaven.    This  is  
     exaggerated flattery to impress a potential romantic partner.   
     Among the  suits in  a deck of cards, the hearts  are known  as livers yate.   kalavo   clubs,   siveti   spades,   
     daimani  diamonds.    
yatevuso  n.  lung(s).   
yati   v.  to  move  slowly,  or  clumsily,  with  effort,  now  a rarely heard  word  except  in  the  idiom :  E  na  qai  
     yati  mai  na  Colo:  We  will  get  there  eventually,  our persistence  will be  rewarded.  Lit.  implication  is  
     that  the mountains will move  slowly down to meet us if we  struggle on. Originally this was  supposed  
     to be  a  saying  of  Vutia people  who  travelled up  into  the  interior  to  trade  their  clay pots  and  mats  for  
     such items as yaqona. Carrying their heavy goods, this was an arduous climb.   
yato, yatova  v. take something by stealth, to snitch, grab.  na ka e yatovi rawa mai.  what can be grabbed.   
yatu  1. n.  row, and by ext. archipelago, as in na yatu Lau  or Na Tu-i-cake  the Lau archipelago.  yatu eliu   
     front  row,  in  football  the  forwards.    yatu  emuri    back  row,  in  football,  backfielders.  Alternative  is  
     iyatu, though not for archipelago.  
yatu 2. n. tuna,  sometimes heard  as atu. This may include  the  skipj ack  (yatusewa, with long  stripes  along  
     belly), albacore (yatu loa, for its black back), yellow fin tuna (yatu ni Toga), and much more rarely the  
     big-eye  tuna  (yatu  levu,  or  dog-tooth  tuna).  Anciently,  little  distinction  was  made  in  Fijian  languages  
     because Fijians rarely caught  any of  these  species;  they did no trolling  and hardly ever fished outside  
     the  reef.  Today,  these  fish  are  caught  commercially  at  sea,  often  12  miles  to  250  miles  from  shore,  
     using long lines, 45-50 nautical miles long, with  some  3,000 hooks, that may take 45 hours to lay out.  
     Tuna  migrate  in  a  clockwise  direction  from  south  of  Kadavu,  around  Fiji.  They  often  follow  lines  of  
     changed  temperature  (even  a degree or two change),  and lines of  change in  the  current.  December to  
     January  are  often  times  of  heavy  catches  but  then  a  month  may  go  by  with  very  little  catch  at  all.   
     Depth  of  the  lines  is  a  vital  matter.  Yellow  fin  are  found  at  30  to  80  feet,  with  the big-eye  somewhat  
     lower.  Largest  catches  are  often  at  100  to  200  feet.   In  waters  less  than  30  feet  deep,  one  finds  walu,  
     crevally,  and sharks, fish that are not valuable for export.  Over-fishing and oriental competition, some  
     of it illegal, has devastated the industry.  
yatu, yatuna  v.  to line up in rows.   
iyatuvosa    n.    (Anglicism)    sentence  (of  speech,  writing).    This  is  of  course  a  modern  term,  as  are  all  
     words of grammar.    
iyau  1.  n.   goods,  wealth .  vutuniyau  rich ,  wealthy.  All  Fijian  goods  were perishable, usually  food,  mats,  
     barkcloth or  sinnet,  salt, coconut oil. They represented power or prestige only  as they were used,  as in  
     presentations  (magiti,  etc.)  or  ceromonial  trading  (solevu).  Durable  wealth  such  as  whaleteeth  were  
     recent  innovations,  only  in  the  1700s, but  only used  in  ceremonial presentations.  Presentation  wealth  
     now  also  includes  kerosene  in  20  liter  drums,  bales  of  cloth .  vutu  ni  yau    rich,  having  many  
     possessions..  yaubula   n.  wealth, precious  goods.   vakayauyau  plentiful,  abundant,  in  great  number.   
     dauniyau (Ang.)  treasurer (as of an association, bank, organisation).  
yau 2.  n.  dew. Syn. tegu, bite.   
yau,  yauta    3.  v.  to  bear  (carry),  take,  bring  (of  many  things  or  people  together),  go  together  (of  many  
     people).  vakayayau  burdened, charged with burdens, carrying things around, plentiful, plentifully  Sa

yavato  n. a very large white tree  larval grub to 25 cm in length, eaten cooked or sometimes  raw by some  
     Fijians. They eat  all but the very  tip of the head  and  are delighted by the taste.  It  is  the  larval  stage of  
     Longhorn  beetle,  Cerambycidae;  two  Fijian  species  are  Xixuthrus  heyrovskyi  and  X.  costatus.  They  
     live  on  rotting  vegetation,  especially  on  forest  trees,  often  high  on  the  tree.  This  is  the  animal  totem  
     throughout  much  of  Namosi  Province  (specifically  the  super-tribe  Nabukebuke),  where  the  word  
     should  not be  spoken.   And  nor  should  the  word  kutekute be  spoken,  which  describes  a  later  stage  of  
     the  beetle's  development.  Similarly,  the  word  qou,  beetle,  should  never  be    pronounced.    The  Fij ian  
     name vuka applies to the Longhorn Beetle but that name is known to very few people.  
           "Operation Yavato " was  an effort by the military revolutionary Sitiveni Rabuka claiming to uncover  
     corruption  in  the  previous  government.  Implied  threats  of  exposure  ensured  compliance  from  other  
     politicians.  Results  were  never  released  to  the  public  or  used  in  court.  Used  figuratively ,  yavato  
     implies secret plots and spying.   
yavega-na  (Colo East) n. armpit.   
yavi, yavia  v. to haul,  as in hauling  a boat  ashore, or into the water, or to haul  in  an  anchor. yavia na wa  
     ni siwa  haul in the fishing line. me yavi na kelekele  haul up the anchor.  See yavi-rau.  
yavi, yavita  v. to hit with a stick or club, to thrash.   
      Idiom:  yavita  dole  na  mataisau    club  the  carpenter prematurely,  i.e., judge  a job prematurely before  
     the work has been completed.  
yavi  rau   traditional  fishing  along  the  coastal  shore,  many people  manning  a  scare-line  that  encircles  the  
     fish  and  then  is  hauled  in.    The  scare-line  is  a  sort  of  rope,  with  leaves  attached,  that  floats  at  the  
     surface.    The  occasion  is  joyous,  gathering  fish  for  some  upcoming  feast,  and  sharing  among  the  
     villagers.  Similar  traditional  fishing took place on the Wainimala  River  in the highlands of Viti Levu,  
     around   village   Nakorosule   for   example.   Three   villages   might   cooperate   in   a   massive   effort,  
     particularly for migrating fish or seasonal fish caught in large numbers.   
yavitu  sevens, as in rakavi le yavitu  rugby sevens, with seven men on a team.   
iyavoi  n.  inter-planted  crop,  usually  harvested  before  full  maturity  of  the  main  crop.  It  makes  more  
     efficient  use  of  land  and  helps  avoid  plant  disease  or  pest  problems  common  with  monoculture.  
     Examples  are bananas or papaya interplanted  among yaqona, or dalo  among yams. Youngsters would  
     not know this word.  
yavu  n.  (Polyn.  origin,  “apu”,  heap)    foundation,  literally  and  physically,  as  in  house  foundation,  or  
     figuratively  (modernly),  refer  to  the  basis  of  something.    In  each  village,  house-sites  are  named  and  
     dedicated to  an extended family, though there may be no house built there. There may or may not be  a  
     stone  foundation  in place.   Chiefly residences  are  referred  to by  the  name  of  their house-site,  and  the  
     name  may  refer  to  the  chief  himself   and  his  immediate  family.  Traditionally,  one  should  not  
     pronounce a person's name. In principle, every house-site has a name and that name indirectly refers to  

                                                               332

     the  family  that  lives  there.  tauyavutaka      to  establish,  to  found.    E  sega  na  yavu  ni  mataqali  vosa

Yavu ni Vakavulewa  (Anglicism) n.  Constitution (government).   
yavuca  n.  improvised shelter to pass the night, bivouac, temporary camp.   
yavula  n.  tarpon, Megalops cypriaoides.   
yavusa  n.  tribe;  largest  kin-group  resident  often  in  one  or  a  few  villages  or  Territories  (Vanua),  usually  
     composed of two or more clans  (mataqali), each with one or more extended families (now often called  
     by  the  standardized  term  itokatoka).    This  concept  and  three-fold  social  division  did  not  exist  in  Fij i  
     until the  arrival of the major Nakauvadra immigration.  It never became traditional in the western part  
     of  Viti  Levu,  which  retained  earlier  Melanesian  social  structure.    The  conceptual  structure  of  tribe,  
     clan, extended family, has in most cases been super-imposed by the Fij i government.  In fact, tribes are  
     often  political  and  economic  agglomerations  of  peoples,  clans  and  families  that  were  originally  
     unrelated.   Often  a  village  contains  only  one  tribe but  there  are  many  exceptions.  And  in  some  areas,  
     like  Namosi,  the  tribe  may  extend  over  many  villages.   Tribes  at  different places  may have  the  same  
     name,  and  were  once  related,  but  are  now  separate  and  independent  of  each  other  (such  as  the  
     Nabukebuke tribe  in Namosi, in Rewa,  and  at Levuka, Ovalau).  In personal life,  many Fijians do not  
     use the term yavusa , and really relate only the family, and to the clan, which usually functions as a unit  
     in perceived rights and obligations.   
yavutu    (Polyn.  origin)    n.  ancestral  village  of  a  tribe,  where  the  tribe  was  formed,  often  as  a  political  
     convenience  after  earlier  wanderings  or  flights  of  escape,  or  separations  of  kin-groups  from  internal  
     conflict  or  lack  of  land  or  water.  All  were high,  fortified  sites  or  ring-ditch  fortifications hardly  older  
     than  300  years  and  virtually  all  have  been  abandoned  as  peace  came  under  colonial  governance.    In  
     many  cases  an  ancestral  spirit  is  associated  with  the  yavutu.    Younger  Fij ians  today  are  not  always  
     familiar with the yavutu concept. A related  concept  is  the koro makawa  old village, where  the people  
     lived  previously.  Virtually  all  Fijian  social  groups  have  moved  about  considerably .  They  had  no  
     permanently  settled  homeland.  The  Native  Lands  Commission  is  based  on  Governor  Gordon ’s  
     misconceived  assumption  that  all  land  “belonged”  to  some  Fij ian  clan.  In  fact,  most  land  was  
     uninhabited,  no-man ’s  land, unused  and  too  exposed  to  attack  for  anyone  to  live  there.    People  lived  
     very compactly in tiny enclaves.   
iyaya n. gear, baggage, belongings,  and by  extension:  iyaya vakatagane  male genitals, private parts,  the  
     polite and usual term.

yawa    (Tonga  ‘awa)  n.    breadfish,  milkfish,  bonefish,  Chanos  chanos,  introduced  from  Tonga,  where  it  
     was cultivated in ponds for chiefs at Ha’apai. It can tolerate brackish water.  Tongans introduced yawa   
     to  freshwater  Lake  Masomo  on  Vanua  Balavu  Island.  There  is  a  joyous  annual  cerermony  around  
     October  of  swimming  and  catching  these  breadfish.  Swimming  stirs  gases  from  vegetative  matter  in  
     the  water  which  incapacitate  the  fish  that  are  then  easily  brought  to  shore.  There  is  ritual  associated  
     with  all  this.  A  documentary  of  the  occasion  has  been  filmed  by  Sir  Richard  Attenborough.    At  sea,

                                             FIJI TRADITIONAL CALENDAR  
  
             Fijians  lived  by  a  lunar  calendar  with  a  climax  of  human  activity  around  February,  when  they  
might  begin  to  harvest  the  cultivated  yam  harvest.    This  is  a  “noble”  crop,  yams  being  prestigious  at  
ceremonial food presentations.   Cultivated yams were also the only basic food that could be stored in their  
natural  state  and kept for use much  later in  the year. All other vegetables  and fruits were perishable.  The  
word  yabaki  signified  the  annual  yam  harvest  and  that  has  been  adopted  as  the  word  for  “year”.    First  
fruits  isevu  of  some  crops  were  presented  to  chiefs  or  priests,  and  more  modernly  also  the  Christian  
church.  Fijians  never  counted  the  years  and  had  no  concept  of  a  weekly  cycle.  There  were  no  dates  on  
their calendar and no names of days, only lunar monthly cycles. They simply followed a  seasonal calendar  
of  events  according  to  biological  changes  and  climate  changes  of  the  year.  The  changes  from  month  to  
month were  signalled by  the flowering or  fruiting of  certain plants, or by the  sea, with the  changes  in the  
available seafood.    
             Highlanders of Viti Levu are of a different culture.  They did not cultivate or honour yams to the  
degree of coastal Fijians. And they had no seafood, only aquatic life from the rivers. Much of this calendar  
does not apply to them.  All too often when people  speak of Fijians they are talking only of Fij ians  around  
the  low-lying  coastal  areas  and  the  smaller  islands  where  there  has  been  a  heavy  Tongan  influence  and  
different physical conditions with lagoons and reefs and groves of mangrove.   
             This  traditional  calendar  of  coastal  Fij ians  has  little  or  no  relevance  in  the  daily  life  of  Fijians  
today, except for those who remain in the remote villages and live a subsistence life mainly from gathering  
and gardening,  and fishing for their own food.   For the rest of us, our interest in the calendar is mainly  an  
interest  in  history  and  biology,  and  the  practical  matter  of  what  fruits,  vegetables  or  seafoods  may  be  
found at the market.    
             Of  course  with  a  lunar  calendar  there  is  no  one-to-one  correspondence  with  our  months  of  the  
modern  calendar.    When  we  name  the  equivalents  in  European  months  it  is  only  approximate.  Also,  in  
fact,  the  tropical  climate  has  inherently  variable  seasons,  not  dependent  only  on  the  phase  of  the  moon.   
We  list  here  what  is  supposed  to  happen  in  each  lunar  month  in  following  the  seasons.    Most  of  these  
observations  have  been  cribbed  from  various  previous  writings;  only  a  few  are  are  original  with  this  
author.    
             Vula  i  Nuqa  Levu.      January.  Named  for  the  great  abundance  of  Rabbit  Fish,  Siganus  
vermiculatus,  a  small  fish  with  fine  texture  delicious  flavour.    They  are  found  close  to  shore  in  dense  
schools, passive  and  easy  to  catch  in  great  numbers.  Also  the  schooling  surmullet  or  goatfish  (ki  or  deu)  
caught  in  fish  fences  (ba).    And  young  baby  shark s  (bulubulu)  at  the  shore.  Shellfish  are  plentiful,  
especially  kai  koso,  kuku,  and  kolakola  (Aetheria  semilunata),  the  chiton  (tadruku),  the univalve  madrali  
(Neretidae)  and  the  sea-slug  (bosucu)  Onchidium  that  exudes  a  milky  substance  when  squeezed.    Land  
crabs  (lairo)  are   spawning  (dere  neke)  at  the  seashore,  especially  the red  variety  of  lairo.  And  the  small  
rock  crab  (sara-valivali)  is full  and rich  (momona). The edible j ellyfish  (drose)  are floating in  abundance  
(and Fij ians talk of  “drinking” the jellyfish ; they  say it  is  laugunu, not eating it  as  a  food which would be  
referred to as laukana.  “Red tide” fish poisoning is a danger at this time.   
             The starch-food Polynesian chestnut (ivi) is gathered. Mango trees are fruiting, mainly important  
in  the  drier  parts  of  the  main  island.  (Mango  hardly  fruits  on  the  wet  southeaster  side.)  Dawa  fruit  is  
harvested  and  the  wi.  Breadfruit  uto  is  fruiting  abundantly.  A  sign  of  the  time  is  the  flowering  of  the  
timber tree damanu. Many flowers  are blooming, used as  isaluwaki, to make perfumed oil  (only in coastal  
areas) or weave in garlands:  lagakali, bua ni Viti, caucau.  The salato shrub is developing thorns.   
             Vula  i  Sevu.   February .   Turning  point  of  the  year.  Beginning harvest  of  cultivated  yam  and  
setting  up  of  yam  storage  shed    (lololo)  in  the  field.    Presentation  of  first  fruits  to  chief  and  Church.  
Plentiful harvest  of breadfruit  (uto),  taro  (dalo),   cassava  (tavioka),   Polynesian  chestnut  (ivi),  the  fruit  of   
the trees wi (Spondias dulcis), dawa (Pometia pinnata),  and oranges.  (Cassava and oranges are introduced  
plants).  A  sign of the time is the flowering of the  timber tree dakua salusalu.  In the fish fences one now  
finds the little fish malevu, voro, resembling and replacing the ki (goatfish).   
             Vula i Kelikeli.   March . Often rainy and a time from thunderbolts (yaseyase).  Main harvest of  
cultivated  yams,  much  to  be  stored.    Long  yams  are  harvested;  some  are  buried.  Certain  varieties  of  
breadfruit (uto) plentiful, ivi  continues,  and the vutu kana matures  as  an additional  starch food.  Avocados  
(introduced) are abundant. It is time to plant sweet potato (kumala).    
             The early,  initial breadfruit  cultivars fruited mainly in March  and  April but cultivars  introduced  
later extended the season considerably.     

                                                                   334

            Sea  crab s  (qari)  are  mature  as  are  mud  lobsters  (mana)  and  the  small  crabs  (kuka).    Fishing  is  
generally poor this month and next.   
            Signs  of  the  time,  this  month  or  next,  of  the  migratory  shore-wading  Golden  Plover  (dilio)  that  
will  depart  Fij i  for  Alaska.    Early  flowering  of  reeds  (gasau),  yalu  vine,  and  the  tokatolu  that  will  also  
come to fruit.  In  some  places early harvest of duruka (Saccharum edule), the fruit of  a vegetable grass  so  
delicious grilled on a fire.    
            Vulu  i  Gasau.    April.  Often  another  rainy  month.  Conspicuous  flowering  of  reeds  gasau.  
Digging  of  long  yams.  Breadfuit  fruiting  in  great  abundance,  citrus,  including  the  shaddock  (moli  kana).  
Signs of the  time include flowering of the trees mako   and damanu. Kavika fruit is reaching the end of its  
season that began six months earlier, in October.  Dilo nuts are rich in oil for massage. The dilio migratory  
birds are now departing Fij i.   
             Freshwater  shellfish  are out of  season.  But mud lobsters  (mana),  sea  crabs  (qari),  and  shellfish  
kuka are daba, full  and rich for eating. The fish tugadra are plentiful in schools at the shore. This is  a time  
for  netting  small  fish,  daniva,  salala,  sara by  the  shore.  The  catch  will be poor  for  larger  fish  away  from  
the shore.    
            Vula i Doi.  May.  The doi  shrub (Alphitonia  spp.) flowers  (small  and white) and fruits,  as does  
the  vesi  leka .    The  short  cultivated  yam  uvi  leka  reaches  maturity  for  harvest,  as  does  the  kawai  yam,  
especially  in  the  drier  areas  of  Macuata  and  Ra.    Sweet  potato  (kumala)  and  arrowroot  (yabia)  are  
abundant  in  the  places  they  grow  best.   Tarawau    nuts  come  to  harvest.  The  tree  yasiyasi,  false  
sandalwood, is fruiting. Along the  coast  there  are many salala  fish in  schools.   Month for  late hurricanes,  
heavy  storms  and  blustery  winds  called  cagi  ni  doi.  The  end  of  this  month  is  normally  the  end  of  the  
hurricane season. Sailing becomes much safer.  
            Vula  i  Werewere.  June.   Cool  weather begins.  The  month  to begin  weeding  (werewere),  and  
planting the first yams.  Kawai yams  are plentiful, as are some of the wild yams  such  as bulou.  Flowering  
occurs for  duruka  and vico.  The coconut crab (uga vule) is uro, rich and plump on the few islands where  
it  still  thrives.  There  is  a  diminishing  supply  of  oranges  and  kavika.  Among  fish,  there  are  many  matu  
Gerridae  ,  and  sardines  (daniva).    The  trees  dilo  and  dakua  salusalu  are  fruiting.    Humpback  whales  
appear offshore, often with their young,  having migrated past New Zealand to Fij i, on their way to Tonga  
before retreating again to the Antarctic. This will continue into July , or later.  The giant sea turtles become  
scarce this month through August.   
            Vula  i  Cukicuki.  July.   Cold  weather.  Digging  (cukicuki)  and planting  of  yams by  the  end  of  
the  month.  Harvesting  sweet potato  (kumala).  Signs  of  the  time  include  flowering  of  moivi,  drala,  vasili,  
and  vaivai  ni  vavalagi,  signals  to  begin  planting  yams.  Flowering  of  drala  attracts  the  Collared  Lory,  a  
lovely sight.  
            The  relatively  modern  crop  of  maize  (sila)  matures  in  July  and  August.  This  is  not  sweet  corn  
but  tough  field  corn,  elsewhere used  only  as  animal  feed, but  in  Fiji used  as  a human  snack  food,  sold  at  
the  market.  (Sweet  corn  would require purchased hybrid  seed,  not  available  to  most  farmers.)  Deciduous  
trees such as tavola, wi, and sinu, will have lost their leaves in these cold months, July and August.   
            The  fish  kesala  (kerakera)  is  spawning  as  is  the  kawakawa.  And  the  octopus  (kuita)  are  now  
becoming common.  Fishing is good for daniva, ose, and matua.   
            Vula i Se-ni-drala (Vula-i-kawakawa).  August.  Cool, unsteady weather brings the end of the  
major  dalo  season  that  began  around  March.  The  tree  damanu  is  flowering,  as  is  the  drala    and  the  
kauceuti.   The mangrove (tiri) is fruiting, as is the vaivai ni vavalagi.  
            High  season  now  for  octopus.  Schooling  of  the  small  sardine-like  fish  vaya  and  the  matu.  The  
fish kesala  (kerakera)  is  still breeding,  as is  the  kawakawa. The giant green turtle  is now mating, drifting  
in couples at the surface of the sea (veibalati na vonu).  
            Vula  i  Vavakada.    September.    Month  for  staking  out  stick  supports  for  yam  vines  (na  
vavakada).    Also  called  vula  i  kadrekadre  month  for  sprouting  (of  yams).    Planting  of  dalo  and  kawai.   
Flowering    of  mango  tree  (introduced  from  India),  drala,  buaniviti,  mokosoi,  wadamu.    Rock  cod  
(kawakawa) is  still  spawning. Fruiting of kaunigai tree. Anciently the beginning of j avelin-throwing  sport  
veitiqa,  after  completion  of  planting.    The  Golden  Plover  dilio  is  now  returning  to  Fiji  from  Alaska  or  
Siberia on its annual migration. (No dilio eggs are ever found in Fij i.)  
            Vula  i  Balolo  Lailai.   October.   Planting  of  dalo,  kawai,  and  via  kana. Boro  sousou  is  in  full  
growth,  as  in  the  medicinal  cagolaya  used  for  coughs  and  colds.  First  appearance  of  edible  sea  annelid  
balolo in some places. Maturity of breadfruit is beginning.  Kavika  fruit is in harvest this month  and next.   
The introduced  avocado  (p ea) is  abundant on Taveuni especially from October through March. Beginning  
of  the  season  for  watermelon  that  will  continue  through  February.  Flowering  of  the  daiga.  Flowering  of  
mokosoi  tree,  so  much  used  for  its  scent  and  beauty  in  personal  decoration  behind  the  ear  and  floral  

                                                              335
