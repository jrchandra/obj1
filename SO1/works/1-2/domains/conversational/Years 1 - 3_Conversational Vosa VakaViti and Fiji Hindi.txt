                                            INTRODUCTION  

The Combine Conversational Textbook is designed for Years 1 to 3 students. The  
book  contains   the   three   major   languages   mostly   used   as   a   medium   of  
conversation in Fiji. Thus, it will allow children to learn, identify and name basic  
terms in the English, Vosa VakaViti and Fiji Hindi Language.  

The  book  will  also  enable  any  teacher  irrespective  of  their  ethnicity  to  teach  
Conversational  Language  in  either  Vosa  VakaViti  or  Fiji  Hindi  to  the  children  
across  Fiji.  There  are  30  lessons  altogether  in  the  textbook  with  10  lessons  for  
each level.  

Each  lesson  is  presented  according  to  the  themes  which  are  aligned  to  the  
thematic approach used in Years 1 and 2. Teachers will determine the number  
of themes they can allocate for each level in a school term depending on the  
learning need and ability of their students.   

The book also has a lot of student activities which hopefully will create interest  
in  students’  learning  of  Conversational  Languages.  The  activities  range  from  
basic, proficient to the advance level for each lesson.  

Finally,   it   is   hoped   that   the   compilation   of   the   Combine   Conversational  
Textbook         will   support        and      enhance          the     teaching         and      learning       of  
Conversational  Languages  for  Years  1  to  3  children  in  all  schools.  Laying  an  
early foundation in the teaching of Conversational Languages will surely pave  
the  way  for  a  better  future  for  our  children  to  learn  and  understand  each  
other’s languages. Most importantly, it will help bring to fruition our aspirations in  
creating a truly ethnically harmonious, tolerant and peaceful society.
