                                        INTRODUCTION 

The Years  4  &  5  Conversational  textbook  contains  the  three  major  languages  spoken  in  Fiji,  
namely the English, Vosa VakaViti and Fiji Hindi language. The content of the textbook has basic  
sentences and it is built upon the names and terms the children have learnt from the Years 1 – 3  
Conversational textbook. 
  
The main rationale of the textbook is to allow the students to converse in simple Vosa VakaViti  
or Fiji Hindi sentences and the Conversational subject shall not be examined. However, teachers  
can conduct oral assessment such as quizzes to gauge the level of students understanding and  
the abilities of students that are non-speakers of the Vosa VakaViti language to speak basic Vosa  
VakaViti sentences and vice versa for students that are non-speakers of the Fiji Hindi languages. 

The Years 4 & 5 Conversational textbook have 30 lessons and 15 lessons have been allocated  
for each year level. Teachers need to distribute 5 themes per school term and must ensure that  
appropriate  time  is  allocated  to  cover  each  lesson. Teachers  also  need  to  consider  the  school  
context, time allocation for Conversational Languages and students learning needs whilst planning  
and delivering the Conversational lessons.  

A table is provided at the beginning of each lessons recapping on the terms and words the students  
were supposed to have learnt from Years 1 – 3.  It is followed by a few simple sentences, phrases,  
questions and answers. The activities are also given to help test the children’s understanding of a  
particular theme.  

Teachers  are  also  encouraged  to  provide  assistance  in  the  appropriate  pronunciation  and  
clarification of any Vosa VakaViti or Fiji Hindi words that the students might face difficulties with. 
The content and activities provided will have enhance the children’s learning and understanding  
of the Vosa VakaViti and Fiji Hindi.  

Finally, the successful completion of this textbook will enable the students to further their learning  
and understanding of Vosa VakaViti and Fiji Hindi language. It is also envisaged that the students  
will  enjoy  learning  Conversational Vosa VakaViti  and  Fiji  Hindi  and  most  importantly  use  it  
while communicating with their friends in schools and in the community at large.
