                                                       INTRODUCTION  

                                                                         

Fiji is a multicultural country and an important policy of the government is to promote  
multiculturalism                in     schools         wherever           practicable.           Therefore           the      previous  
Conversational Beginners and Intermediate textbook has been revised and combined  
to  include  the  three  major  languages  spoken  in  Fiji,  namely  the  English,  Vosa  
VakaViti and Fiji Hindi language as well.   

It is anticipated  that students will learn to communicate in each other’s language,  
and eventually assist in helping the Fiji multicultural communities to understand  
each other better and help build a harmonious Fiji where all citizens can all live in  
harmony.  

The Years 6 – 8 Conversational textbook contains 60 lessons from which 20 lessons  
are allocated for each year level. The content of the book is also available on CDs and  
DVDs to allow the students to familiarise themselves with the content requirements  
at  their  individual  rates.  The  lessons  are  oral,  in  nature,  aiming  purely  at  oral  
communication for subjects related to everyday life situation.   

It  is  envisaged  that  students  will  enjoy  participating  in  Conversational  languages  
lessons and most importantly, be able to communicate what they have learnt in their  
everyday communication with their peers and members of the community they live  
in.

   Hello children…                             Hello teacher.  

   First, let us learn how to greet each other. 
   In doing so, we use the word…Bula…Bula…Bula. 

   In Fiji Hindi we use the word …Hello … Hello … Hello 

   Samisoni is a good friend of Mereoni……let’s listen to how they greet each  
   other 

        Samisoni:  Bula, Mereoni…       Hello, Mereoni

  Thank you….  Now, listen to Samisoni as he greets some of his relatives:

     Usha:                               Bula, Usha       … Hello, Usha.

 Bula  ragone…                               Ni sa bula saka.  

 Hello children…                             Hello teacher.  

 Today we’ll learn how to greet each other in the morning. 

 In our last lesson we learnt how to greet each other at any time of the day  
 like this 

 Bula … Hello …Sa Bula … Hello …and…Ni sa bula … Hello 
 we also learnt how to say our good-byes like this…  Moce, Sa moce & Ni  
 sa moce … good bye. 

 Today we’ll learn how to say good morning like this: … Yadra … 
 Yadra… In Fiji Hindi we use Good morning  

 Listen carefully to how Akisi and her friends greet each other in the  
 morning. 

     Akisi:         Yadra Mereoni    …     Good morning, Mereoni.                  
     Mereoni:    Yadra Akisi         …     Good morning, Akisi. 

     Akisi:        Yadra Samisoni   …     Good morning, Samisoni.            

     Samisoni:  Yadra Akisi         …     Good morning, Akisi. 

      Akisi:         Yadra John         …    Good morning, John. 

      John :        Yadra Akisi         …    Good morning, Akisi. 

   
 Now, class say the word three times after me: 
       Yadra … morning … yadra … morning …yadra …  morning 

       Again    yadra… morning … yadra … morning …yadra …   
        morning 

                                          11

LESSON 20 

 Lesson      At the end of the lesson, students should be able to follow  
Outcome      simple classroom intructions using other vocabularies such as  
             “Look at …….” in Vosa VakaViti or Fiji Hindi. 

 Bula  ragone…                             Ni sa bula saka.  

 Hello children…                         Hello teacher.  

 In this lesson, we’ll revise the following: 
      Stand up …        Tucake … Khadha ho  
      Sit down …        Dabe …     Baitho  
      Come and sit … Mai dabe … Aao baitho 

and we will learn the following: 
     Look at … Raici …  Dekho 
      Look    …  Raica … Dekho 

 Let’s try this again with the Radio Class: 

 Ask these children to stand up like this …Tucake … Khadha ho 

          Ashok … Tucake, Ashok. … Khadha ho, Ashok. 
     Mahen … Tucake, Mahen. … Khadha ho, Mahen. 
     Naren … Tucake, Naren. … Khadha ho, Naren. 
     Renuka …. Tucake, Renuka. … Khadha ho, Renuka. 

 With the Radio Class invite the same children to come and sit down like  
 this … Mai dabe … Aao baitho. 

     Ashok … Mai dabe, Ashok. … Aao baitho, Ashok. 
     Mahen … Mai dabe, Mahen. … Aao baitho, Mahen. 
     Naren … Mai dabe, Naren. … Aao baitho, Naren. 
     Renuka … Mai dabe, Renuka. … Aao baitho, Renuka. 

 With the Radio Class…tell the same children to sit down like this…     
    Dabe … Baitho. 

     Ashok …  Dabe, Ashok. … Baitho, Ashok. 
     Mahen … Dabe, Mahen. … Baitho, Mahen. 

                                        63 

----------------------- Page 66-----------------------

     Naren …  Dabe, Naren. … Baitho, Naren 
     Renuka … Dabe, Renuka. … Baitho, Renuka. 

 Now, listen carefully:  

     Raici Ashok … Raica na rula. 
     Dekho Ashok … Ruler ke dekho. 

     Raici Mahen … Raica na peni. 
     Dekho Mahen … Pen ke dekho. 

      Raici Naren … Raica na penikau. 
      Dekho Naren … Pencil ke dekho. 

     Raici Renuka …Raica na katuba. 
      Dekho Renuka … Pallah ke dekho. 

 Say this three times with me:  

     Raici … dekho …raici … dekho …raici … dekho. 

 again.........three times 
     Raici … dekho …raici … dekho …raici … dekho. 

 Listen and think… Now, we say… 

     Raici Ashok … Dekho Ashok, Raici Mahen … Dekho Mahen,  

     Raici Naren … Dekho Naren  

 but we say: … 
     Raica na rula … Ruler ke dekho  
     Raica na Peni …. Pen ke dekho,  
     Raica na Penikau …. Pencil ke dekho 
     Raica na Katuba … Pallah ke dekho. 

     Raici … dekho … is followed by names of people like Ashok,  Mahen,  
     Naren or Renuka 
     Raica … ke dekho … is followed by names of things like ruler, pen,  
     pencil, or door 

      Now, with the Radio Class, use… raica … dekho or…raici … ke   
     dekho in the right place: 

     Mahen … Raici Mahen. …. Dekho Mahen. 
     Kishor … Raici Kishor. …. Dekho Kishor. 

          Katuba … Raica na katuba. 

     Pallah … Pallah ke dekho. 

                                           64

     Katubaleka … Raica na katubaleka. 

     Khidhi … Khidhi ke dekho.

     Jope … Raici Jope. … Dekho Jope. 

     Kato … Raica na kato.

LESSON 25 

 Lesson       At the end of the lesson, Students will be able to provide  
 Outcome      appropriate response when someone enters the room in Vosa  
              VakaViti or Fiji Hindi. 

 Bula  ragone…                             Ni sa bula saka.  

 Hello children…                          Hello teacher.  

 Today we’ll teach you to say when someone knocks at the door and you  
 have to invite him/her to enter… 

 First, someone will be knocking at the door and the teacher’s response  
 will be this: 
     Yes, come in … Io, curu mai … Ha, bhitar aao. 

 Next, the teacher will need to welcome the child like this” 
     Good morning (name)… Sa yadra vinaka…Good Morning 

 And the reply from the child could be like this: 
 Ni sa yadra vinaka saka … Good morning 

 Now, shall we listen to the Radio Class as they demonstrate this drill:        
     (Sound of knocking at the door) 
 R.T:        Io, curu mai. … Ha, bhitar aao. 

     Mereoni      (enters the room). 

 R.T:        Sa yadra, Mereoni.  …  Good morning, Mereoni. 
 Mereoni:  Ni sa yadra saka…Good morning Teacher. 

 (Sound of knocking at the door) 
 R.T:        Io, curu mai… Ha, Bhithar aao.   

     Samisoni     (enters the room).

 Akisi      (enters the room). 

 R.T:        Sa yadra, Akisi ... Good morning, Akisi. 
 Akisi       Sa yadra saka … Good morning 

  (Sound of knocking at the door) 
 R.T:        Io, curu mai … Ha, bhithar aao.   
 John       (enters the room). 

 R.T:        Sa yadra , John … Good morning, John. 
 John:       Sa yadra saka … Good morning 

 Now, children can you all repeat this after me: 

     Io, curu mai … ha, bhitar aao ... Io, curu mai … ha, bhitar aao…  
     Io, curu mai … ha, bhitar aao. 
 This is interpreted to mean Yes, come inside. 

 Please, say this after me 

     Sa yadra, Mereoni          … Sa yadra, Mereoni. 
     Good morning, Mereoni … Good morning, Mereoni.

     Good morning, John … Good morning, John. 

      Sa yadra saka               … Ni sa yadra saka. 
     Good morning, Teacher … Good morning, Teacher. 

 ‘Ni’ and ‘saka’ are used to show our respect  
 for the teacher. I hope you still remember this  
 from our first lesson. 

 Anyway, class teacher please pick five children to be at the door, and  
 one by one let them knock and enter the classroom. All the children in  
 the class will pretend to be the teacher. They will therefore need to say  

                                            80 

----------------------- Page 83-----------------------

 knock before you enter boys and girls. 

     Are you ready? …Class teacher please take over…                 (pause)

 Mereoni:  (enters the room) 

 R.T:         Sa yadra, Mereoni  …  Good morning Mereoni. 
 Mereoni:  Ni sa yadra, saka. … Good morning, Teacher. 

  Listen to this once more: 

  (Sound of knocking at the door) 
 R.T:          Io, curu mai … Ha, bhitar aao.  

 Samisoni (enters the room) 

 R.T:         Sa yadra, Samisoni … Good morning Samisoni. 
 Samisoni: Ni sa yadra, saka. …  Good morning, Teacher.

 knocking at the door and let’s go through that drill again with all other  
 children in the classroom pretending to be the teacher.

      Au sega ni rogoci kemuni … T um suna nahi tum konchi bola. 

Once more listen:  

      Au sega ni rogoci kemuni … Hum suna nai tum konchi bola. 

 Together with the Radio Class please repeat after me: 

      R.T: Au sega ni rogoci kemuni … (together) … Au sega ni rogoci  
        kemuni. 

        Hum suna nahi tum konchi bola … Hum suna nahi tum konchi  
        bola. 
 Again       

      R.T. Au sega ni rogoci kemuni … Au sega ni rogoci kemuni. 

      Hum suna nahi tum konchi bola … Hum suna nahi tum konchi  
     bola. 

 Thank you … now face your partner and say this three times: 

     Au sega ni rogoci kemuni … Hum suna nahi tum konchi bola. 

 Now, listen carefully as I combine the two sentences. 

     Au kerea mo ni vosoti au … Au sega ni rogoci kemuni. 
      Konchi bola, please fir se bolo … Hum suna nahi tum konchi bola. 
 Listen again: 

     Au kerea mo ni vosoti au … Au sega ni rogoci kemuni. 
     Konchi bola, please fir se bolo … Hum suna nahi tum konchi       
     bola. 

Now, let’s listen to the Radio Class as they say those sentences: 

      R.T:    Io Samisoni, na cava o vinakata? … Ha Samisoni, tum   
              konchi mangta hai? 
     Samisoni: Au kerea mo ni vosoti au … Konchi bola, please fir se       
            bolo. 
                                           88

           Au sega ni rogoci kemuni … Hum suna nahi tum konchi  
           bola. 

     R.T:  Io Akisi, na cava o vinakata? … Ha Akisi, tum konchi  
           mangta hai? 
     Akisi:  Au kerea mo ni vosoti au … Konchi bola, please fir se bolo. 

              Au sega ni rogoci kemuni … Hum suna nahi tum konchi  
            bola. 

     R.T:    Io John, na cava o vinakata?  
               Ha John, tum konchi mangta hai? 
     John: Au kerea mo ni vosoti au.  

              Konchi bola, please fir se bolo. 

               Au sega ni rogoci kemuni.  

              Hum suna nahi tum konchi bola. 

 Class Teacher… please get your children to work in pairs …  one to  
 pretend to be the teacher 
 and to say: Io (name of the child,) na cava o vinakata?... Ha (name of  
 the child), tum konchi mangta hai? 

 And the other child to respond by saying this: 
       Au kerea mo ni vosoti au .Au sega ni rogoci kemuni. 
       Konchi bola, please fir se bolo… Hum suna nahi tum konchi bola. 

 Now, we’ll change … still working with your partners … those who were  
 pretending to be teachers will now pretend to be students and those who  
 were pretending to be students will pretend to be teachers. We shall go  
 through the same exercise again. 

 Vinaka vakalevu ragone… Thank you Chidren …That’s all for now…until  
 our next lesson, 

 Moce ragone…                  Ni sa moce saka. 
 Good bye Children…   Good bye Teacher

  Listen …. (Sound of knocking) someone is knocking at the door…..  
  What should we say?  

  Did you say…Come inside…Curu mai…Bhitar aao…thank you. 

  Now teacher, please send three children outside to knock at the door. 
  While each child knocks, let the class say…Curu mai…Bhitar aao…The  
  children will enter one by one… Class teacher, please take over…(pause) 

  Teacher, please divide the class into two groups. Group 1 will invite  
  Group 2 to eat with them and Group 2 will give the response. So when I  
  say …fish…ika…machri ,Group 1 will say… Come and eat fish… Mai  
  kana ika……Aao machri khao. Group 2 will then respond and say…. 
  Thank you, I have eaten.….Vinaka , au sa kana oti….Thank you,

Listen carefully,…Biuta ike na ivola…Book yaha rakho… (3 times)  

Repeat this three times after me…Biuta ike na ivola/ Book yaha  
rakho … (3 times)  

Now, together with the Radio Class say the sentence after I say the  
words eg:…  

ivola….book…you’ll say…Biuta ike na ivola…Book yaha rakho  
…isele…churi…Biuta ike na i sele…Churi yaha rakho…and so on.

           Book le ke aao…            Book le ke aao.  
  
           Kauta mai na isele…      Kauta mai na isele…

               Kauta mai na ikoti…     Kauta mai na ikoti…  

           Kaichi le ke aao…          Kaichi le ke aao.  

               Kauta mai na peni…      Kauta mai na peni…  

           Pen le ke aao…               Pen le ke aao.  

               Kauta mai na rula…       Kauta mai na rula…  

           Ruler le ke aao…            Ruler le ke aao.  

  

Now, when I say … ivola… book…you say … Kauta mai na  
ivola…Book le ke aao and when I say isele…churi…you  
say…Kauta mai na isele…Churi le ke aao and so on.  

Are you ready?  

  

               ikoti…   kaichi…    Kauta mai na ikoti… Kaichi le ke aao.  
                ivola…   book…      Kauta mai na ivola… Book le ke aao.  

               isele…    churi…     Kauta mai na isele… Churi le ke aao.  

               peni…    pen…                           Kauta mai na peni… Pen le ke aao.   

               rula…     ruler…      Kauta mai na rula…  Ruler le ke aao.  

               teveli…  table…      Kauta mai na teveli…Table le ke aao.  

               jaina…   kera…       Kauta mai na jaina … Kera le ke aao.  

  

Now, we can combine the two sentences like this: ...Bring the scissors  
and put/ leave it here…     Kauta mai na ikoti, biuta i ke….Kaichi  
le ke aao, yaha rakh do.  

Can you all say that after me:  
    Kauta mai na ikoti, biuta i ke…Kaichi le ke aao, yaha rakh do.  

    Kauta mai na ikoti, biuta i ke…Kaichi le ke aao, yaha rakh do.  

    Kauta mai na ikoti, biuta i ke…Kaichi le ke aao, yaha rakh do.  

Now, let’s try our drills….when the Radio Teacher  
says…..ikoti…kaichi….you say…Kauta mai na ikoti, biuta i  
ke….Kaichi le ke aao,yaha rakh do.……. or when she says …..  

isulu/sulu….you say…. Kauta mai na isulu, biuta i ke…Sulu le ke  
aao, yaha rakh do.  

  
                                                                    113

  Hello Children…          Hello Teacher  

  Today we shall teach you how to ask another question:

     conversation like this:
