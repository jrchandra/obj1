                                              INTRODUCTION  

  

The  Years  9  &  10  Conversational  Textbook  contains  the  three  major  languages  
spoken  in  Fiji,  namely  the  English,  Vosa  VakaViti  and  Fiji  Hindi.  By  the  end  of  the  
course, students will be able to learn, understand and speak Conversational Vosa  
VakaViti or Fiji Hindi independently.    

The  Conversational  subject  shall  not  be  examined.  Teachers  can  conduct  Oral  
Presentation, Speech, Group work, Dialogue and Role Play to gauge the level of  
students’ understanding and the abilities of students who are non-speakers of the  
Vosa VakaViti language to speak basic Vosa VakaViti sentences and vice versa  
for students who are non-speakers of Fiji Hindi.  

The Years 9 & 10 Conversational Textbook has 24 lessons. The lessons are designed  
purely  for  oral  communication  on  subjects  related  to  everyday  life  situation.  
Teachers  need  to  distribute  the  themes  per  school  term.  Consistent  coverage  
within  a  time  frame  is  not  required  in  Conversational  subject  as  lessons  can  be  
repeated  until  the  students  are  able  to  speak  independently  in  Conversational  
Vosa  VakaViti  or  Fiji  Hindi.  Teachers  need  to  consider  the  school  context,  time  
allocation  for  Conversational  Languages  and  students’  learning  needs  whilst  
planning and delivering the Conversational lessons.   

Teachers       are     also    encouraged           to   provide      assistance        in   the    appropriate  
pronunciation  and  clarification  of  any  Vosa  VakaViti  or  Fiji  Hindi  words  that  the  
students  might  have  difficulties  with.  The  content  and  activities  provided  will  
enhance children’s learning and understanding of the Vosa VakaViti and Fiji Hindi.   

We believe that when you learn to communicate in each other’s language, you  
are helping the Fiji multiracial communities to understand each other better and  
help build a better Fiji where we can all live in harmony.
