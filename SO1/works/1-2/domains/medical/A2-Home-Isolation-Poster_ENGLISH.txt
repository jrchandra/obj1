           In this example, Mika lives with Joji, Maria and Sova. Mika is the first case of COVID-19 in this household. He and everyone in the household begin self-isolating from the  
           day Mika’s symptoms start (or if he had no symptoms, from the date of his positive test). If someone in the household is at high risk of severe COVID-19 – in particular  
           individuals over 50 years, have a chronic illness such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, asthma, are obese, or are pregnant – we need them to visit one of our  
           screening clinics and get tested. If you test positive, then we will ensure you are provided immediate care by our health teams.
