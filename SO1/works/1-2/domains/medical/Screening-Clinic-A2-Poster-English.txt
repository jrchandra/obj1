Screening Clinic Services 

The Ministry of Health and Medical Services is targeting COVID-19 testing for  
individuals in high risk groups.  This is to identify and treat those at risk of severe  
illness from COVID-19 and to prevent further hospitalisations and deaths.  

If you, or someone you are caring for has mild COVID – 19 symptoms (cough,  
runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, fatigue, headache, aches and pains,  
sore throat, fever, diarrhoea, red eyes, loss of taste or smell) 

AND  
-   over 50 years of age 
-   or have existing illness such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease,  
    asthma, are obese 
-   or are pregnant 

Please visit a screening clinic and get tested. If you test positive, then we will  
ensure you are provided immediate care by our health teams. 

NOTE: If you experience mild symptoms and do not fall into any of the groups  
above, you do not need to be tested. Most people infected with COVID-19 will  
have mild symptoms and will fully recover at home with no medical intervention  
necessary. Please immediately isolate yourselves from others including your  
family members and monitor your symptoms. Should you begin to experience  
severe COVID-19 symptoms, go immediately to one of our dedicated health  
facilities. 

   For symptomatic workers who need official leave from work, they are  
   recommended  to  attend  the  nearest  screening  clinic  to  be  checked  and  
   obtain a medical certificate for 14 days of self-isolation at home. 

   Symptomatic  workers  can  also  obtain  a  medical  certificate  for  the  14  
   days self-isolation at home, from participating General Practitioners (GPs).
